done bush done farmade war taliban al qaeda enhanced domestic security six months attacks truly entering realm presidential choice indications bush going use september th occasion launch new aggressive american foreign policy would represent broad change direction rather specific war terrorism rhetoric especially two addresses given joint sessions congress since september th information state mind aides leaked indicate sees nations moment destinya perception people around seem encouraging enhances bushs stature opens way assertive policymaking inside government reason september th appears transformative moment senior official lunch put much revealed existence threat officials previously unaware drastically reduced american publics usual resistance american military involvement overseas least clinton administration beginning black hawk operation mogadishu first year operated conviction americans highly averse casualties allbombing kosovo operation clintons nexttolast year ideal foreign military adventure united states attacked options much broader senior official approvingly mentioned study casualty aversion triangle institute security studies argued mass public much

total vietnam war fiftyeight thousand september th presumably reduced casualty aversion even recently went white house interview condoleezza rice rices foreign affairs article begins declaration united states found exceedingly difficult define national interest absence soviet power asked whether still case think difficulty passed defining role said immediately think september th one great

goal way newin bushs speech congress september th americas sole grand purpose ending terrorism talked west wing office tall windows face part white house grounds television reporters standups bearing rice seemed less crisply military public looked little tired projecting kind missionary calm rather belligerence foreign affairs article rice came across classic realist putting forth notions power politics great powers power balances proper central concerns united states sounded moved closer onepower idea cheneys pentagon team proposed ten years agoor least idea great powers harmony united states terrorist attacks induced remain theoretically realists would predict great power like united states would long great powers rising challenge trying balance rice said think youre seeing theres least predilection time move productive co perative relations united states rather try balance united states actually think statecraft matters comes foreordained rice said called together senior staff people national security council asked think seriously capitalize opportunities fundamentally change american doctrine shape world wake september th really think period analogous saidthat period containment doctrine took shapein events clearly demonstrated big global threat big global threat lot countries would normally thought coalition started shifting tectonic plates international politics important try seize position american interests institutions harden national security council legally required produce annual document called national security strategy stating overall goals american policyanother government report whose importance great obvious bush administration produce one last year clinton administration first year rice said working report two ways handle document told one kind minimalist way get view since going first one bush administration important awful lot happened since started process prior cant give certain date going would think sometime spring important real

incidentally particular case people working frequently pull hundred thousand dollars year much goes back tribal corporation rather pockets somewhat annoying federal government semiregularly grants

economic original point tangent one thing always interested concept quasitribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement type corporate socialism mindbogglingly bad execution use structure
