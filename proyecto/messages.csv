spam,dear friend,i am mrs.  sese-seko widow of late president mobutu sese-seko of zaire? now known as democratic republic of congo (drc).  i am moved to write you this letter, this was in confidence  considering my presentcircumstance and situation. i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons george  kongolo  and basher  out of democratic republic of congo (drc) to abidjan, cote d'ivoire where my family and i settled, while we later moved  to settled in morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. however due to this situation we decided to changed  most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for  safe purpose because the new head of state of (dr) mr laurent  kabila has made arrangement with the swiss government and other european countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures  deposited in some european countries. hence my children and i decided laying low in africa to study the situation till  when things gets better, like now that president kabila is dead and the son taking over (joseph kabila). one of my late husband's chateaux in southern france was confiscated  by the french government, and as such i had to change my identity  so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. i have deposited the sum eighteen million united state dollars(us$18,000,000,00.)  with a security company , for safekeeping. the  funds are security coded to prevent them from knowing the content. what i want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our behalf.acknowledge this message, so that i can introduce you to my son (kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. i want you to assist in investing this money, but i will not want my identity revealed. i will also want to buy properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments. may i at this point emphasise the high level of confidentiality,  which this business demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which i repose in you. in conclusion,  if you want to assist us , my son shall put you in the picture  of the business, tell you where the funds are currently being  maintained and also discuss other modalities including remunerationfor your services. for this reason kindly furnish us your contact information, that is your personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose.best regards,mrs m. sese seko

spam,dear sir,  i am dr james alabi, the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.   there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of n.n.p.c. the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of us$12,320,000.00 (twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united state dollars). this amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.    consequently, my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign  accounts in our names. needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in  return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the  transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.   modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.  our assurance is that your role is risk free. to   accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.  once more i want you to understand that having put in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my country, i am averse to having my image and career  dented. this matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.   please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction, if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction.  i want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.   i quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from in full honor.  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.   thank you and god bless.  dr james alabi      
spam,hello...by reading the short summary just below, you will see how you can learn new skills in communication, do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at the same time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you to change your life!!!  ************summary***************************  just read this summary, follow the actions that it advises, and start earning some serious money.  you will learn new skills in communications and how to market on the internet. what a deal!  your total cash investment is just $50.00.  step 1.  if this is the first time you have seen this message, and you have not joined in this program before, then take out five us$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five guides on communications.  for each guide that you will be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white paper, your own name, address, and your own email address, and the number and name of the guide that you are buying.  then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill inside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and address of the person whose name is shown under each guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air mail. be sure to put enough postage stamps on the envelopes.  no need to send by registered mail.  list of five names**************************** ________________________________________________  guide# 1: "how to be a more effective public speaker" order guide #1 for us$10.00 cash from: (in addition to guide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing guide "a million bucks from the internet", free of charge)  derrick nguyen  9530 whitmore st  el monte, ca 91733  usa ________________________________________________  guide # 2: "how to give a business presentation" order guide # 2 for us$10.00 cash from:  tim fai gpo box 260 macau (via hong kong) ________________________________________________  guide# 3: "how to write more effectively" order guide # 3 for us$10.00 cash from:  luis pastor apartado 81 48080 bilbao spain ________________________________________________  guide # 4: "what to do at a social function" order guide # 4 for us$10.00 cash from:  chester waldvogel 11 chestnut way berlin, md 21811 usa ________________________________________________  guide # 5: "how to sharpen your mind" order guide # 5 for us$10.00 cash from:  j. siden krondikesvagen 54 a 83147 ostersund sweden ________________________________________________ end of list of five names*********************  step 2.  these guides will be emailed to you.  save these guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you, paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers.  step 3.  from the list of names above, delete the name and address of the person shown under guide#5, and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide #4's slot.  be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown. check the address again.  step 4.  delete name and address under guide #4, and replace with the name and address from guide #3's slot.  step 5.  delete name and address under guide #3, and replace with the name and address from  guide#2's slot.  step 6.  delete name and address under guide #2, and replace with the name and address from guide #1's slot.  step 7.  delete name and address under guide #1, and replace with your own name and address. this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides. eventually, your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide #5, and then be dropped from the list. the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.  step 8.  once you have completed this new list, send out this new email (which shows your name under guide #1) to as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000 emails or even more.  the greater the number of mailings you make, potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide #1 from you.  these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide #2, and so on.  this is all you need to do.  if you wish to read the rest of this email message, then do so.  if not, just do the 8 steps shown above. remember, the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own.  do not change anything other than what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you.  your immediate reaction might be: why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends. that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people.  but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit. what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new buyers. if the people you slip into that list aren't going to be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  there wouldn't be new buyers coming in. so, your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero!  furthermore, if you have done the work, and your name has worked its way to further down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  don't do it to others. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!  you may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money, and not send you the guide.  well, rest assured.  as we said above, it's to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers.  so don't think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to "stiff" you for $10.00.  the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you.  later on, when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides, fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer.  don't cheat. provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit. ******end of summary************************  =======rest of message======================  with easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before. and the earnings potential is staggering!  read this email to the end! - follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not, or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for.  yes, i know what you are thinking. i never responded to one of these before either. one day though, something made me feel: "you use $50 going to a movie for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple meat at a restaurant.  why the heck not?"  no matter where you believe those "feelings" came from, i thank every day that feeling came over me.  i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing had i not. read on. it works.  and when you read the guides, you ll learn how to become a more effective communicator. what can be better?  a way to improve your self-image and confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover your investment and make some good money: making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. if you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct marketing on the internet.  if you believe direct marketing via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done in the future, then the experience you will gain here could be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing a new career for you.  = print this message for future reference =  if you want to make serious money, read this message until you understand it completely and feel confident to follow through on what it advises.  follow the simple instruction above and your financial dreams can come true!  remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work!  this is a legitimate business. you are offering a product for sale to a buyer. treat it as such and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five.  =========================================== *** take this entire email, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes.  there are 2 methods to get this venture going:  method # 1: by sending bulk email legally ===========================================  let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each. let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1% (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.1%). also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5,000 each.  out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only 5 orders for guide # 1. those 5 people who responded also send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. out of those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders. that's 25 people who responded and ordered guide # 2.  those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 125,000 emails. the 0.1% response to that is 125 orders for guide # 3. those 125 people send 5,000 emails each for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. the 0.1% response is 625 orders for guide # 4.  those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 3,125,000 emails. the 0.1% response to that is  3,125 orders for guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per guide.  this may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out.  see what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly.  if response rate is 0.1%, income from guides #1 - #5 is: $50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)  if response rate is 0.15%, income from guides #1 - #5 is: $75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795  if response rate is 0.2%, income from guides #1 - #5 is: $100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 emails each or more?  from the example above, you can see the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.  there are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.  method # 2: placing free ads on the internet ===========================================  advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response. we strongly suggest you start with  method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along. for every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the guide the buyer ordered. always provide same day service.  the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address.  in return, when others buy the guides from you, you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to their email addresses.  this will benefit you because your name would be further down the list, and their new buyers will buy from you.  this is no different than "customer service" in the retail or the  "bricks and mortars" business.  ===========available guides ============== the reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or somehow  "wrong". it is simply about time. time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  order each guide by its number & name only. always send a single $10 bill (u.s. currency) for each guide.  checks not accepted. make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the guide you are ordering, your email address and your name and postal address.  be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope.  place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your success guidelines  === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for guide #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.  === two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders, you should receive 100 orders or more for guide #2. if not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.  once you have received 100 or more orders for guide # 2, you can see the program is working, and cash should continue coming in! this is important to remember:  continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails. you can keep track of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another batch of emails and start the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you can generate !!! =========================================== a note from the originator of this program: you have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life, but i don't wish to kid you:  this requires a bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed.  remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in guide#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them. remember, the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach.  it is up to you!

"my first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "there was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year".  the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.  as it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via e-mail, a type of  "report" to e-mail addresses that he obtained off the internet. everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.  "i just got the e-mail one day and i figured what the heck, i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.  the e-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list.  the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "i get junk e-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.  within the first few days of sending out the e-mail, the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.  "about a week later i rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [post office] counter. i thought i was in trouble or something (laughs)". he goes on, "i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all".  over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the e-mail."  the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework".he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties,  fifties and hundreds.  "i didn't want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but i just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."  surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.the reporting news   team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.in fact, it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws, title 18, section 1302 and 1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also in the code of federal regulations, volume 16, sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.  every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "please send me report number xyx".this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (a report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [this is the end of the media release. if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. what  appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions].  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ be financially free like others within a year!!! before you say "bull", please read the following. this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the  internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".   due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained, it is currently working better than ever.   note* follow the directons below, i had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.  in order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. i have been extremely successful using the following company. they send out the offers, and all i do is accept money for reports, then i send back to the people as soon as possible.  this is what one had to say: "thanks to this profitable opportunity. i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".  pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ here is another testimonial: "this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything." more testimonials later but first,  print this now for your future reference  ++++ order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++ for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the  report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on your envelope top left  corner in case of any mail problems.   when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer. within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.   important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose out on majority of your profits. once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will not work!!! people have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. but it does not work this way. believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!   1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report #5. 3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report #4. 4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report #3. 5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report #2 6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.   please make sure you copy every name & address accurately! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes. save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:   method #1: by sending bulk e-mail legally +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.   with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that equals 100 people responded and ordered report # 2.  those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report #3.  those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4.  those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report #5. that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half million). your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000....... grand total=$555,550.00   numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? there are over 150 million people on  the internet worldwide and counting. believe me, many people will do just that, and more!   method #2: by placing free ads on the internet +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response.   we strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add method #2 as you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all orders. this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.  =order each report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail  address and your name and postal address.   place your order for these reports now: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ report #1: the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net  order report #1 from: r. r. po box 18048 chicago, il 60618 __________________________________________________________  report #2: the insider's guide to sending bulk e-mail on the net  order report #2 from: gm boland 353 jonestown rd. suite 125 winston salem, nc 27104 __________________________________________________________  report #3: secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report #3 from: r. chernick po box 771661 c.s. florida 33077 __________________________________________________________  report #4: how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm & the net  order report #4 from: m. eiseman po box 451971 sunrise, florida 33345-1971 ____________________________________________________  report #5: how to send out 0ne million emails for free  order report #5 from: l.samon po box 31 castletown isle of man im 99 5xp  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  +++ if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. =orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report #2. if you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  +++ once you have received 100 or more orders for report #2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business!!!  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ following is a note from the originator of this program: you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is now.  remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information,  materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  it is up to you now!

within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody in her "hobby".  mitchell wolf, chicago, illinois  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ "not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back". "i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big".  dan sondstrom, alberta, canada  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ "i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks".  susan de suza, new york, n.y  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ if you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the office of associate director for marketing practices, federal trade commission, bureau of consumer protection, washington,d.c. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  this email was sent to you via saf-e mail systems. your email address was automatically inserted into the to and from addresses to eliminate undeliverables which waste bandwidth and cause internet congestion. your email or webserver is not being used for the sending of this mail. no-one else is receiving emails from your address. you may utilize the removal link below if you do not wish to receive this mailing. http://www.webtransit.net/remove.html

spam,the ultimate way to work from home  the best money making system of all!!  as seen on national tv  as seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. this is not a scam.  i hope this is ok that i send you this. if you aren't interested, just  simply delete it.  read this message if you are like me and want more than your lousy  weekly paycheck. make more in a few months than last year at work.  believe it, work it.  this really works, don't make the same mistake i made. i deleted this  4-5 times before finally giving it a try. within 2 weeks the orders  (money)  started coming in just like the plan below said it would. give it a  try!!  you will be glad you did.  thanks and good luck! you won't need luck, just keep reading. don't  delete this!!!  ------------------------------------------------------  first read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. see below....  as seen on national tv: this is the media report.  parents of 15 - year old - find $71,000 cash hidden  in his closet!  does this headline look familiar? of course it does.  you most likely have just seen this story recently  featured on a major nightly news program (usa).  and reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck  of the woods - new zealand). his mother was cleaning  and putting laundry away when she came across a large  brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath  some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her  15-year-old sons closet.  nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got  when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash.  five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds -  all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.  "my first thought was that he had robbed a bank",  says the 41-year-old woman, "there was over $71,000  dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband  earns in a year".  the woman immediately called her husband at the  car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she  had discovered. he came home right away and they  drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  little did they suspect that where the money came from  was more shocking than actually finding it in  the closet.  as it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via  e-mail, a type of "report" to e-mail addresses that he  obtained off the internet. everyday after school for  the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom.  "i just got the e-mail one day and i figured what the  heck, i put my name on it like the instructions said  and i started sending it out", says the clever  15-year-old.  the e-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained  instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person  on the list, then delete the address at the top and  move the others addresses down, and finally to add  your name to the top of the list.  the letter goes on to state that you would receive  several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2  weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the 5-address list. "i get junk  e-mail all the time, and really did not think it was  going to work", the boy continues.  within the first few days of sending out the e-mail,  the post office box that his parents had gotten him  for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to  fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing  $5 bills.  "about a week later i rode [my bike] down to the post  office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300  envelops stuffed in it. there was also a yellow slip  that said i had to go up to the [post office] counter.  i thought i was in trouble or something (laughs)". he  goes on, "i went up to the counter and they had a  whole box of more mail for me. i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not  carry it all".  over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending  out the e-mail. "the money just kept coming in and i  just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet,  barely had time for my homework". he had also  been riding his bike to several of the banks in his  area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties  and hundreds.  "i didn't want the banks to get suspicious so i kept  riding to different banks with like five thousand at a  time in my backpack. i would usually tell the lady at  the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to  exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me.  one time the lady gave me a really strange look and  told me that she would not be able to do it for me and  my dad would have to come in and do it, but i just  rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."  surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be  afraid. the reporting news team examined and  investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter  at all. in fact, it was completely legal according to  us postal and lottery laws, title 18, section 1302 and  1341, or title 18, section 3005 in the us code, also  in the code of federal regulations, volume 16,  sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service  must be exchanged for money received.  every five-dollar bill that he received contained a  little note that read, "please send me report number  xyx".this simple note made the letter legal because he  was exchanging a service (a report on how-to) for a  five-dollar fee.  [this is the end of the media release. if you would  like to understand how the system works and get your  $71,000 - please continue reading. what appears below  is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -  you can use it too - just follow the simple  instructions].  thanks to the computer age and the internet !  ==================================================  you will make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your  home!!  before you say ''bull'', please read the following. this is the  letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the  popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news  program  recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show  also  investigated whether or not the program was legal.  their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely no  laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow  the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only  $25 out of pocket cost''.  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this  program has  attained, it is currently working better than ever.  this is what one had to say: '' thanks to this profitable opportunity.  i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so  glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for  the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received  total  $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.  pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey.  ========================================================= =======here is  another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a  long time but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this  again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the  simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to  come  in. first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that  made a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering  the  program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the  key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change  anything.'' more testimonials later but first:  ===== print this now for your future reference ========  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  if you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily  and comfortably, please read the following...then read it again and  again!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$  follow the simple instruction below and your financial  dreams will come  true, guaranteed!  instructions:  ================order all 5 reports shown on the list below  =================  for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report  you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose  name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return  address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail  problems.  === when you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5  reports.  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer  and resell them. your total cost $5 x 5=$25.00.  within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports  from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will  be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them  from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk  in case something happens to your computer.  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed  next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other  than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will  loose out on majority of your profits. once you understand the way this  works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. remember,  this  method has been tested, and if you alter, it will not work !!!

 1.... after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement  and remove the name & address of the person in report #5.  this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting  their fortune.  2.... move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.  3.... move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.  4.... move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.  5.... move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately!  ========================================================= =======  **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it  on your computer. do not make any other changes.  save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. to assist  you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you  purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which  includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of  free  classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this  venture going:  method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally  ========================================================= =======  let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and  we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.  let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the  response  could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. also many  people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000  each).continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.  with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1  those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total  of 50,000.  out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's=100  people responded and ordered report # 2.  those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000  e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3.  those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5  million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders  for report! # 4. whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a  total of  50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000  orders for  report # 5 that's 100,000 orders times $5 each=$500,000.00 (half  million).  your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500  + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ grand  total=$555,550.00  numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the  worst possibleresponses and no matter how you  calculate it, you will still  make a lot of money !  ========================================================= =======  remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering  out  of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if  everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails  each or more? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide  and counting. believe me, many people will do just that, and more!  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  ========================================================= =======  advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the  internet will easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you  start with method # 1and add method # 2 as you go along. for every $5 you  receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's  it. always provide  same day service on all orders.  this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your  name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise  until they receive the report.  ===================available reports  ==========================  order each report by its number & name only. notes: always  send  $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure  the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on  one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you  are ordering,  your e-mail address and your name and postal address.  place your order for these reports now :  ========================================================= =======  report #1 "the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net"  order report #1 from:  k.palludan  9550 summersweet ct.  las vegas, nevada 89123  usa  ________________________________________________________________ ______  report #2 "'the insider's guide to sending bulk e-mail on the net'  order report #2 from:  kris estes  3055 casey drive #203  las vegas, nevada 89120  ________________________________________________________________ ______  report #3 "'secret to multilevel marketing on the net"  order report #3 from :  p. clement  601 st-malo est  ile bizard, quebec h9c2p2  canada  ________________________________________________________________ ______  report #4 "'how to become a millionaire utilizing mlm and the net"  order report #4 from:  david carpenter  13 dutch lane  hazlet, new jersey 07732  usa  ________________________________________________________________ _____  report #5 "'how to send out one million e-mails for free"  order report #5 from:  s. lasley  4230 edgewood circle  idaho falls, idaho 83406  usa  ________________________________________________________________ _____  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2  weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.  === after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you  should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you did not, continue  advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  === once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can  relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will  continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your  name  is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report  people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income  send  another batch of e-mails and start the whole process  again. there is no  limit to the income you can generate from this business !!!

 within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she  had  received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! i was shocked. ! i have  joined  jody in her ''hobby''.  mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois  ========================================================= ======= '' not  being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my  mind to participate in this plan. but conservative that i am, i decided  that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that  i  wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' i was  surprised  when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. i made  $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. the nice thing about this deal is  that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a better  investment  with a faster return and so big''.  dan sondstrom, alberta, canada  ========================================================= ======= '' i had  received this program before. i deleted it, but later i  wondered if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who  to contact ! to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed  again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came  again.....i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my  first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''.  susan de suza, new york, n.y.  ========================================================= ======  '' it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with  little cost to you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and  within 10 days the money started to come in. my first month i made  $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $  362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to internet''.  fred dellaca, westport, new zealand  ========================================================= =======order  your reports today and get started on your road to  financial freedom !  ========================================================= =======  if you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the  office of associate director for marketing practices, federal trade  commission, bureau of consumer protection, washington, d.c.  ========================================================= =======  there is no need to respond to this e-mail if you do not  wish to receive  further correspondence. this is a onetime e-mail.  good luck!

spam,kevin george abidjan,cote d'ivoriewest africa dearest one, although we have not met, i got your contact through the internet and decided to contact you for assistance. i was, until recently, a final year engineering student of the university of sierra leone,west africa. early in january last year, the rebelsin my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. my late father, king christopher george being the king of the town was a prime target. fortunately for me, i was in school when the attack took place. i equally lost my only sister to the rebels. when i got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, i discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6m.united states dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. this money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an auto repair company for me by my late father,when i complete my studies. upon the discovery of this document, i travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving nextof kin to my father. but deliberatley, i have decided to keep all my uncles and aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know i am in possession of such money. i have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that i am the next of kin and all the documents related to are now with me. i do not know what to do with it but i have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such atime that i will be ready to begin to use it. i am really desperate as i am left alone now in the world.let me know what you want as compensation for helpingme to solve this my problem. most importantly,iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684i remain yours sincerely, kevin george   yahoo! mail -- une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran ais !

spam,attn:  i am bulawa mulete jr. the son of mr.   steve mbeki mulete from zimbabwe. i am sorry this mail will surprise you, though we do not know,  due to the current war against white farmers in zimbabwe and the support of president robert mugabe to claim all white owned farms in our country to gain favor for re-election.  all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president idea. he then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. they killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm. after the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. the will  documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as  personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could easily be found by his enemies. the total amount is us$21.5m.we are therefore soliciting for your assistance to help us move the fund out of zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from reality, hence this mail to you. the president's present ban of international press into zimbabwe and the drop from office of the  finance minister to avoid giving white farmers fund transfer clearance above us$1m is just a few of the unthinkable things he is committing in my country. i have tried to reach my father's close friend mr. john casahans from australia also a farmer who was leaving in zimbabwe with us but left with his family late last year following this ugly development to no avail. should you be interested to help us, contact me immediately via email for easy communication and i will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction. we have concluded a wonderful plan of  caring out the transfer within two weeks. please note that  this transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will  not endanger you or us in any way. we have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any account of your choice were the incident of taxation will not take much tool on the money and we look forward to coming over to your country to invest our share and settle there. i will a private phone so that our conversation can be 100% confidential.  note: do reply to bulmulete@golfemail.com   god bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.  mr. bulawa  mulete jr      --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

spam,dear sir,,   my name is dr steven m duba , the son of mr. theo duba of zimbabwe. i got your address from south african information exchange johannesburg. .  due to the previous war against white farmers in zimbabwe by president robert mugabe and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. my father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt mugabe. the president s supporters invaded my father s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested him and confiscated all his investment.  early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president mugabe started, my late father envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of zimbabwe through diplomatic means to south africa. when he arrived south africa, he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in south africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company, then, went back home. he registered the box as family treasure.  while he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in south africa because of the escalation of the crisis in zimbabwe. he did not want my life to be in danger. he was arrested on the 5th of march last year. unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of december 2001.i came to south africa march,2002.  now my stay here in africa is frustrating and depressing because my father s lawyer is presently hospitalized in london due to terrible heart problem; though the lodgment documents are with me, as such i want to relocate to your country for good. presently, my residence permit here in south africa is an asylum permit as a refugee.  i am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company (us$15 million) out of this country to your country for investment. if you think you can help me, please try to get in touch with me immediately with the  number below . your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me. since the problem in my country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret, because i wouldn t want anything that will expose me, and the existence of this money.  your urgent response will be highly appreciated.  sincerely yours,  steven duba (dr).  tel:27-83-713-2696           __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? yahoo! finance - get real-time stock quotes http://finance.yahoo.com

(phase-out of 141b)  #136-10 brian d, canada  there has been a lot of talk about ceramic coatings. we are a distributor of such a coating. we have never professed an r-20. reason = is there isn't an astm test available to measure coatings for r-value. we compare standardized insulation to ceramic coatings via btu loss calculations. depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket. we have the data and the projects to prove it.  #136-11 cpi we have inquiries from a number of people for used equipment - especially gusmer h20/35, h2000, h2, gx-7 and glas-craft probler. please contact 805-552-9128.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ end of messages.   this forum welcomes anyone interested in the processing of single- or plural-component materials such as polyurethane, polyurea, coatings, epoxies, and other spray-applied materials.   the industry forum. a free eservice from    to ask or answer a question, or to contribute anything, simply send an e-mail to forum@cpillc.com    used gusmer h20/35 and probler gun for sale!805-552-9128   your privacy is protected! please read the policies and rules at cpillc.com.   show your name here! become a sponsor! call 805-552-9128 or send an email to cpi.   read this and previous forum issues all on one page. it will only work if you are connected to the internet! click here to go to cpillc.com/forumdiscussion. htm.   visit cpi, llc on the web. click http://www.cpillc.com/   cpi is authorized distributor for all leading manufacturers in this industry including gusmer, glas-craft, graco, resin technology, dynasolve.   cpi's customers enjoy impartial advice, full service, life-long free phone support, training and set-up with all new system at a very fair price!   shop our online warehouse 24/7most efficient procurement anywhere! www.cpillc.com/warehouse.htm   job marketspray jobs  did we miss someone? feel free to submit any number of e-mail addresses of coworkers and friends to be included here. again, this service is free for all! help grow our forum!   we're cpi.we make it work!   call us toll-free877-cpi-2100805-552-9128 copyright (c) 2000, 2001, 2002 cpi, llc. all rights reserved.disclaimers and limitations of liabilities posted at cpillc.comthis free eservice is made possible by cpi.please visit their web site at www.cpillc.com or call toll-free 877-274-2600 or 805-552-9128.if you wish to unsubscribe, please hit the reply button - subject = remove. please allow 3 days to take effect.

"a honolulu-based attorney created the "kingdom of enenkio" in the early 1990s. it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed." http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00)  the purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific 1000 miles south of tahiti.** (comment: the construction of this statement implies the marshall islands are in the south pacific ocean 1000 miles south of tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.)  correction: dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific, 1000  miles south of tahiti, and now includes taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific. **however, the marshall islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, ...**  (comment: just because the rmi government "...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...enenkio...", does that make it true? why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?)  **...namely the dom and sister nation, the kingdom of enenkio (the marshallese name for wake island),...**  (comment: nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for dom, but as for the kingdom, we don't even know what being a "sister nation" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, his majesty king remios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?)  correction: the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and  the same could be said for dom.  **...claiming to represent the mid-pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france- presse.** (comment: the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio, who are forced to live in exile from eneen-kio atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. furthermore, "...an article in agence france-presse" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government. my preceding comments apply. the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an "...investment scam...". we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. in fact, we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut. one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. doesn't anybody check sources anymore?)  **the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.**  (comment: the kingdom of enenkio has made no "fraudulent claims" of which i am aware, and in my post, i am responsible for all published information. i would personally caution any "..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..." nations, companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect. however, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source. furthermore, the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the marshall islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **a honolulu-based attorney created the "kingdom of enenkio" in the early 1990s.**  (comment: mr. moore is not an attorney, though he was living in honolulu in the early 1990s.)  correction: the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the  owner of eneen-kio atoll [a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and 6-8 other names], iroijlaplap murjel hermios, who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls [he passed away in december 1998] and was fully recognized by the rmi government. he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel (sic) hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.**  correction: the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made  possible by murjel's appointment of mr. robert moore, the adopted brother of hermios, alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen, to the post of minister plenipotentiary. the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr. moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen-kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios' and the people's behalf.  **the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed.** (comment: since when is a special power of attorney an "agreement"? the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney, except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen-kio atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful rmi boundaries. the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen-kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) finally, i suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.  skip to next file  top of page  june 3, 1999- sir: the following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the kingdom of enenkio (thank you for spelling 'enenkio' correctly. the purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio.  "fantasy island" -- "melchizedek passport scam reveals how the internet can take fraud to new frontiers" by bertil lintner in bangkok, december 10, 1998: "determined not to give up, pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to taongi atoll in the western pacific. according to a melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of enenkio," another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the u.s.-held wake island. in real life, taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the marshall islands."  http://www.feer.com/restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of december 24, 1998: "fantasy island", disconnected as of 2/1/00) response to the author: i am unable to locate the "melchizedek press release" you cited, indicating that "...taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of enenkio,...". such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands. further more, melchizedek (dom) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government.  the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the 19th day of september, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. however, a prior agreement, signed in may 1997, which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio, transferred mr. robert moore's rights to develop taongi from mr. moore to dom. it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. this was made possible because mr. moore is the alab (one class of landowner) of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll, from the principal landowner, iroijlaplap (paramount chief) murjel hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by mr. moore, who is also the adopted brother of hermios. now, please understand, that while mr. moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of taongi, which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios, mr. moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio. iroijlaplap hermios, also wore (he died in december 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as first monarch, king of the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen-kio atoll (a.k.a. enen-kio, halcyon, disclerta, wake and several other names). for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is "...another only-in- cyberspace country...", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio. and, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon his majesty king hermios, the sovereign of enenkio and eneen-kio atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. i suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent u.s. invasion of eneen-kio atoll, properly named by 'marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. in closing, i would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. skip to next file  top of page  june 2, 1999- sir: the following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your footnotes to history -d and e (disconnected as of 12/1/00). "enenkio atoll- in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific. after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally. the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims. the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i. king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987. the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek." comment: with all candor, i cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which i am assuming is not the case) in the history of the kingdom of enenkio, i am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio, i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. for your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color:  **in 1898, the united states annexed wake island, in the marshall islands of the western pacific.**  correction: in 1898, the united states invaded wake island, the  northernmost atoll -- actually named eneen-kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the ratak chain of marshall islands in micronesia and the central north pacific ocean. the author responds: "rest assured that i did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the american acquisition of the territory." **after the marshalls became a u.s. trust territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called enenkio locally.** correction: following w.w.ii, the trust territories of the pacific, which included the marshall islands, was placed under administration of the united states by the united nations. while eneen-kio was well established as one of the marshalls, the u.s. only knew it as wake and, having lost many u.s. lives there in 1941 at the hands of japanese invaders, kept control of it. in 1993, the paramount chief of the ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of eneen-kio atoll.  the author responds: "i don't see much conflict between the two versions here."  **the u.s. government has consistently ignored these claims.** correction: the u.s. government has consistently ignored claims from the marshall islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including iroijlaplap murjel hermios. the author responds: "i will note this." **the protests took a sharper turn after the u.s. congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai'i.** correction: the eneen-kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the u.s. congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of hawai'i by a group of american businessmen and u.s. marines, and in the following year returned the island of kaho'olawe to the hawaiian people. **king murjel hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls, declared wake island's independence in 1987.** correction: king murjel hermios, who was paramount chief until his death in december 1998, declared the sovereign state of enenkio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen-kio atoll, ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy.  the author responds: "i will make the necessary corrections here." **the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states, hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls, which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek.**  correction: after the death of the first monarch, his brother remios  succeeded to the throne as second monarch and rules along with his brother, crown prince lobadreo, over the kingdom of enenkio today. to continue the commentary: the parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the kingdom of enenkio itself. since hm king remios also succeeded to iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. but that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the kingdom of enenkio. i have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter.  the author responds: "i imagine that you are asserting here that moore's melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the sources & bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. be assured i will look further into\par this. thank you again for your response, captain rydell. i should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so." (june 7, 1999)  skip to next file  top of page june 1, 1999: news release part one background:  on may 21, 1999, the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands posted a "press release" on the internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). the author, "mr. joseph biglar, undersecretary", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, nor with its monarch, his majesty king remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of enenkio. there is no valid reason to assume that the said "press release" is indeed an official document. the republic of the marshall islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the kingdom of enenkio, headed by his majesty king remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be marshallese nationals residing in the marshall islands. response to so-called "press release":  this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, by the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is wholly false. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the republic of the marshall islands, which has been confirmed by the u.s. state department. (see: human rights report) this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the marshall islands government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention.  the rmi is unequivocally cognizant that the kingdom of enenkio:   exists as a sovereign state as defined by the montevideo convention (1933).    was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign,  iroijlaplap murjel hermios, in 1987.    was established by way of a public authority, the constitution  of the kingdom of enenkio atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.   has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the dominion of melchizedek   has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as  - now quoting mr. biglar's statement - "rmi geographical and political boundaries."    exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and  matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of marshallese customary law (reinforced by the rmi constitution), upon the acknowledged iroijlaplaps of the northern ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands.   has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political  jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll to the government or people of the dominion of melchizedek or to any other entity, including the republic of the marshall islands.  mr. biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the republic of the marshall islands:    also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the montevideo  convention (1933).    was conceived as a separate state by (un) foreign governments,  which included the united states, china and the ussr.   was also established under a public authority, the constitution of the marshall islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.   has no relations with enenkio that allows rmi knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the dominion of melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the rmi to be condemned by mr. biglar.   has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll, which was not incorporated into the rmi in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.   exercises authorities founded upon the rmi constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of eneen-kio atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.   has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the kingdom of  enenkio in their every attempt to get the rmi government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of iroijlaplap hermios, and the rmi has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said iroijlaplap hermios.  the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the republic of the marshall islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the kingdom of enenkio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the monarch of the kingdom, his majesty king remios, as head of state, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures.  furthermore, in light of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade of the republic of the marshall islands announcement concerning the kingdom of enenkio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the preamble of the constitution of the marshall islands, then you decide for yourself:  "with this constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal." on behalf of his majesty king remios, we, administrators of the kingdom of enenkio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[paragraph 4] thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging ofc. the newest ofcs, e.g., niue and the marshall islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the pacific. even more "remote" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the dominion of malchizedek (sic) or the kingdom of enenkio atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice." [note: ofc = offshore financial center] response: this unprovoked attack upon his majesty king remios, monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, the sovereign state of enenkio and its noble citizenry by the u.s. department of state is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the kingdom of enenkio. it is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of his majesty king remios, the government of the kingdom of enenkio and organs thereof.  the unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the united states to attempt to link the kingdom of enenkio with international crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. this public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the united states government that any attempt to interfere in the business of his majesty king remios, iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls of the marshall islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention.  furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the president of the united states issues a formal apology to his majesty king remios, along with the government of the kingdom of enenkio, and the congress of the united states initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the united states of the islands and seas of eneen-kio atoll. congressional representatives to hawaii, the nearest state of the united states to eneen-kio atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. the united states is obligated as the self-assured trustee of pacific island states in micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic cleansing" and her responsibility to enenkio is no less. for further

readers from the ministry of foreign affairs: subject: a "state of war" declaration the kingdom of enenkio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the united states government. the united states government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in "taking possession" of sovereign property in the northern ratak state, which then had formal treaties with the republic of germany. the explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese. because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on marshallese society have not healed. thus a current state of adversity exists. following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island, the government of enenkio, on behalf of the marshallese king, issued the "'state of war', a declaration" and broadcast it to the world. the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out. it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief, king murjel hermios. in retrospect, the declaration has had little visible effect. while a state of adversity does exist, the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon. the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government. such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations. the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people.  while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u.s. congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the un charter, conventions of the united nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the u.s. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity. the refusal of  the u.s. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the marshallese people to whom the u.s. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the united nations and its members. your understanding is appreciated.  skip to next file  top of page december 19, 1998: news release  subject: death of the monarch of the kingdom of enenkio  the government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first monarch of the kingdom of enenkio, his majesty king murjel hermios. embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 january 1999. memorial services, held in the marshall islands where hm hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional marshallese leaders. his remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. irooj hermios was head of state of the kingdom of enenkio, revered as monarch over the islands of eneen-kio atoll, esteemed as iroijlaplap and high chief of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. his successor as iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a council of traditional leaders. selection of a successor to the monarchy of the kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. in the interim, a reagent will serve as head of state. hm hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as iroijlaplap. aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the marshalls, part of micronesia in the north pacific ocean and first discovered by european seamen in the 16th century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the marshall islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. today this area is commonly known as wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the united states. in one of the most courageous acts in recent times, irooj hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of eneen-kio atoll for his beloved people. (the account of his acts to establish the kingdom of enenkio as an island state, independent of the governments of the marshalls and the united states, may be researched at the official internet site. on behalf of the government of the kingdom of enenkio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the marshall islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish marshallese domination over eneen-kio atoll. we are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to marshallese ancestry and traditions. in lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming new year are extended to all in peace. news article  skip to next file  top of page  july 14, 1998: communiqu to correspondents recent articles defaming the government of the kingdom of enenkio have been maliciously published under the guise of a marshall islands government warning against "fraudulent claims". we have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the marshall islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. we urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the kingdom of enenkio which are not validated. to that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. for your advice, the following statement was issued by the state secretary of the kingdom in reply: the kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. no claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. we are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of hm king hermios, to resolve the virtual "state of war" that exists with the united states government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations.  the kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) "asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..." of the rmi. we are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the united states from the shores of eneen-kio atoll so natural marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. as to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. we say, let the issue be played out in the people's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. while we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'tre is clearly mandated in the preamble to  the constitution of enenkio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org  referencing the news article in the marshall islands journal entitled "kingdom of enenkio sets up in new zealand," of may 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the kingdom's web site. the kingdom of enenkio does not sell passports! if you have evidence to the contrary, our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. you are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport, that such an act is patently illegal.  the published statement, "the group ...claims to represent iroijlaplap murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain...", is wholly false. i have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our internet site to refute the statement. the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the ratak atolls surely are. contrary to their libelous statements, the kingdom of enenkio was not "created" by robert moore and he is not a "honolulu-based attorney." hm king murjel hermios is the acknowledged hereditary iroijlaplap of the northern ratak atolls and is also first monarch of the kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. "enenkio" [sic] (actually enen-kio or eneen-kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first marshallese name for a marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of bok-ak (taongi) atoll. "wake" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered eneen-kio atoll by unknown western society writers.  skip to next file  top of page may 4, 1997: news release  subject: issuance of gold stamps  the government of the kingdom of enenkio proudly announces commissioning of its inaugural issue of gold stamps. this announcement, made at the first sunday hawaii stamp, coin and postcard show may 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of gold stamps by the kingdom. stamps are expected to be off the presses by early june 1997. first day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official "first day of issue" by the kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the enenkio philatelic mint mailing list.  background - the kingdom was established in march 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in september 1994. however, due to u.s. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the kingdom lingers in "exile". several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in europe, south america, usa and elsewhere.  a nation in conflict - the land in question, commonly known as wake island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: wake, wilkes and peale. few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll eneen-kio lived in the marshall islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. by way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to "wake" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. the united states of america began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by congressional apology to hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the monarchy.  "state of war" - by way of an official march 1997 declaration sent to top u.s. officials, the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a virtual "state of war" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from united states warships. the primary objective of the notice was to request a congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states. calls to end u.s. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the united states government. inaugural issue - the gold stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. for that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. however, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. the extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. note: stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money.  closing comments - the government of the kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region. in doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the "state of war" with the federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. the proceeds from the sale of gold stamps will help fund the restoration of the kingdom and end the conflict in peace.  skip to next file  top of page march 31, 1997: news release  an official document entitled a declaration, was sent march 22 to top executive and legislative officials in the federal government of the united states, including selected cabinet members. the document asserts that: "a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of acts by the federal government of the united states." this is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. one of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states.  this latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the kingdom was established in march 1993, each with similar objectives. calls for the u.s. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the king, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the united states.  the land in question, commonly called wake island, is comprised of three small islands, wake, wilkes and peale, named by "western explorers" for western persons. what of the native discoverers? the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands, the united states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. historical records reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships, en route to the philippines on war missions, and subsequent congressional action, were the sole basis of the u.s. claim. the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east. such a station was never established at wake island. it was destined to become a military installation.  however, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u.s. president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed. but since the u.s. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war, the objections fell into oblivion. it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. the u.s. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the caa (predecessor of the faa) allowed pan american airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. clearly, the so-called annexation by the u.s. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its "ownership" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. when the u.s. congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy in 1993 and the u.s. navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the "natives" of hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake island. the islands of eneen-kio, as the northernmost atoll in the ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of micronesians living in the more "hospitable" islands of the marshall group. while not being used for navy target practice as kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of eneen-kio atoll and the military mission at wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the american public. even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by christian missionaries, natives continued to use eneen-kio, authority to go there being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap (paramount chief). king murjel hermios holds that title today. by way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to wake island. the u.s. cannot produce a title. the hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership.  upon the basis of events and actions by the united states, the administration of the kingdom of enenkio, by virtue of the declaration, "yields to the recognition that a state of war" exists over the island nation. this is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. sovereignty and independence of the kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. the belief is that truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of u.s. "ownership" and occupation. native north americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. in the declaration, demands are made as follows:   "...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable  accord for the survivors of the said state of war...".   "if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and war reparations to citizens."    "...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every  action of every kind in or on enenkio atoll or within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone..."    "...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the department of the interior   "...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than twenty-seven consecutive months and most recently referenced by a certified invoice, no. 97-us-03, dated march 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."   that the "...congress of the united states is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...".  the government of the kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the kingdom of enenkio atoll as an independent nation under god. it seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the united states and asks them to use their influence accordingly. appeals are being made to the united nations. news article skip to next file  top of page  february 6, 1995: news release  on behalf of his majesty, king murjel hermios, monarch of enenkio atoll, titular head of state, paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of pacific ocean islands of the marshall islands, i bid you a warm marshallese greeting -- yokwe! the purpose of this notice is twofold: first, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. as long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the united states remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. summary of events 1993-94: two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the pacific ocean, enenkio, formerly known as wake island. the first was issued on february 25, 1994. it followed two announcements: 1) officials of the us air force at hickam afb, hawaii said in articles published new year's eve and day in both honolulu newspapers that the usaf no longer wanted to maintain wake island airfield and wanted to turn it over to interior department or another military organization by 1 february and abandon it by 1 october, 1994;  2) us army space and strategic defense command of huntsville, alabama issued an environmental impact assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of wake island; part of the "star wars" program, i am led to believe.  an emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of enenkio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. letters to mr. clinton, members of congress, u.s. army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of enenkio (wake i., peale i., wilkes i.), denounced the army's so-called "no significant impact" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the marshall islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims.  on march 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of enenkio as an independent nation under the authority of his majesty murjel hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to mr. robert moore, appointed minister plenipotentiary. the constitution, succession act and other documents were thereafter drafted. on september 30th, a formal declaration of sovereignty was signed into law by ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the usa founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. it declared the kingdom of enenkio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged his majesty, king murjel hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as head of state and embraced the constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government.  documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the united nations, un security council, nato, south pacific commission and others. letters of personal appeal were sent to un leaders. a special request for protection and assistance was sent to the un security council. on october 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the united states regarding the illegal january 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of eneen-kio atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international human rights law, un charter terms and terms of the compact of free association with the republic of the marshall islands (public law 99-239; january 14, 1986). having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the u.s. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of us$100 million. the second official press release was issued on november 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the marshall islands journal, a weekly newspaper and islands business pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly.  request for media response:  the thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? how about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the pacific in the name of "world leadership"? or is it world domination? people of enenkio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage:  1. investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by u.s. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of eneen-kio atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (note: these facts and validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.)  2. investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and u.s. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of enenkio . (note: it is my understanding wake was "decommissioned" after the so-called "processing" of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).  3. reflect on the contrasting history of u.s. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.  4. respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of enenkio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner.  5. bring to light u.s. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (note: congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.)  6. fully disclose to the people of the united states u.s. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen-kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for human rights protected under international law, united nations charter and conventions and the u.s. compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (note: u.s. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island, kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens.)  parting shot:  what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the u.s. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u.s. federal government. our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western "civilized" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of "manifest destiny" which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago. if this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of american attempts at "fixing up the world". the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen-kio atoll pre-dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more. it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. people have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. in conclusion, i reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u.s. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god-given individual rights. thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.  top of page november 21, 1994: news release  in a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include wake island, site of a u.s. military outpost, his majesty, king murjel hermios, through his legal representative, minister plenipotentiary, robert moore, the u.s. has been given the boot out of wake island. moore served legal notice on top u.s. government officials in october 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. the filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of king hermios) by the gun boat, uss bennington in 1899.  the legal document, a commercial affidavit, declaration of fair value and demand for payment, was served under recognized principles of common law and international commercial codes. it details the specifics of king hermios' ancestral rights to wake island, the illegality of the u.s. claim and violations of native laws, international agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the hermios property. it also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995.  while putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, u.s. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep king hermios and the citizens of enenkio living in compulsory exile.  eneen-kio atoll, a name derived from marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including wake. predecessors in interest of king hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to eneen-kio atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years bc. during the colonial invasion of pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. a case in point is in that of the hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the u.s. congress and president bill clinton for the illegal u.s. government overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy. king hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary paramount chief (iroijlaplap) of all the northern atolls of the ratak archipelago of the marshall islands, which terminates to the north, beyond eneen-kio atoll. mr. moore has full authority to act on the king's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted occupation forces in favor of restoring the king's assertion of his native allodial rights. most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the u.s. air force command, 15th logistics group, hickam afb, hawaii. nearly identical articles published in the star bulletin and honolulu advertiser on december 31, 1993 and january 1, 1994 headlined: "air force willing to give up its hold on wake island" and stated: "not much activity there anymore, so the air force wants to give up control". according to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of king hermios, his predecessors and people. mr. moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of state. the democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its executive council.  since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, mr. moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the united states, military officers and members of congress. the following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, king murjel hermios:   formal letters to president clinton and vice-president al gore in february 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. as a military base, wake airfield was "decommissioned" more than a decade ago.    in response to the environmental assessment of the proposed  theater missile defense rocket launch activities, formal letters of protest sent to the pentagon and u.s. army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from wake island over several years into the waters of the marshall islands, went unanswered.   letters to members of the u.s. congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered.   a resolution dated march 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of enenkio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of king murjel hermios. it was likewise ignored. after waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the declared status of enenkio and having heard no objection from the united states, mr. moore assembled the ministers of the executive council. they, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to eneen-kio, formally passed and signed the declaration of sovereignty on september 30, 1994. they also accepted the draft of the constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing his majesty, king murjel hermios as head of state and his family as the first royal family of enenkio . while the king and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of eneen-kio atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the emperor of japan, the emperor of germany, and the king of spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of truth, honor and peace. those principals are embodied in the constitutions of enenkio and of the united states. those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the u.s. congress in public law 99-239 (jan. 14, 1986), signed by president ronald reagan as the compact of free association with the marshall islands and federated states of micronesia. the compact acknowledges superiority of all marshallese "natural" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.  still mindful of the

spam,it was the spring of 1979.    i was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  each day in the cafeteria, i walked from table to table ...  stealing other kids' lunch money.  no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal.  "let me borrow two dollars today," i said, "and i'll bring you five dollars next week."  the investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  of course  when "next week" rolled around and i couldn't pony up the cash, i promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.  eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and i didn't even get beat up.  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.  first of all, greed is your number one enemy. you're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead.  don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.  second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. they are looking out for their own money, not yours.  the "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is now.  according to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "never".    in a sense, they are right.  if you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  but here's the problem:  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich?  hell no!  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it. it's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  if you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it?  where would you travel?  what kind of car would you buy?    the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy.  you want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  you don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was unstable.  that's how you're going to make the  money.  what i'm talking about here is day trading.    my father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.   the day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of xyz for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  he acts quickly, taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours, sometimes within minutes.    i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  it's not rocket science, and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.    the truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.    popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  they don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.  they make their money only if you believe two lies:  1) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.  2) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.  here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively do not want you to know ...  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.    after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, i've learned the following lessons:  ** achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  ** anyone can do it.  ** it only takes a few hours to learn.  when i discovered the secret to day trading, i didn't become wealthy overnight.  if you want instant cash, drive to wal-mart.  buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. the  only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination.  after learning the fundamentals of day trading, i started  practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living, and i was pulling close to a six figure income. in less than three years with no  formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, i had made my first million.  the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book, the master trader.  you will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as i teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that i've used profitably year after year.  the income of the day trader can be staggering.  thousands, even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.  the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this: knowledge.  i will provide that knowledge, and i will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.   average income of a day trader:  5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year.  27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year  11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year   after reading the master trader, you will discover extremely  profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness.   here is just a snippet of what i will teach you:  *** make money whether a stock goes up or down.   *** learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.   *** learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make.   *** learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market!    *** learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success.    *** profit on huge intraday price swings.   *** make money on the biggest news stories.   *** actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns.    *** learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use.   *** learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    it's time to ask yourself: "am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell?  or am i going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money right now in the stock market?"  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker, or yourself?  with the master trader e-book, you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading ... from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars.  the master trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight-forward book ever written about active  trading. if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future.  oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market.    six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the california coast - with cash.  oops, they weren't laughing anymore.  in a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth.  if you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game.  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the master trader e-book right now.  i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.  you don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  it's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.  order the master trader e-book right now for only $49.97 by clicking on the link below:  http://4tools4life.com/qs  ****************************************************** our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails. to be removed from this list, please send an email to "bulkexpert@yahoo.com" ****************************************************** 8149uuyq4-233hric7588tjuy9-579ziua2166lzlr3-402tyer3917ynrp5-992zkl62

spam,it was the spring of 1979.    i was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles.  each day in the cafeteria, i walked from table to table ...  stealing other kids' lunch money.  no, i didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made them a little deal.  "let me borrow two dollars today," i said, "and i'll bring you five dollars next week."  the investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  of course  when "next week" rolled around and i couldn't pony up the cash, i promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer.  eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year's lunch money.  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and i didn't even get beat up.  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn.  first of all, greed is your number one enemy. you're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead.  don't wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket.  second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. they are looking out for their own money, not yours.  the "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is now.  according to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is "never".    in a sense, they are right.  if you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years.  but here's the problem:  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich?  hell no!  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it. it's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old  in a wheelchair.  if you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it?  where would you travel?  what kind of car would you buy?    the fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy.  you want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later.  you don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was unstable.  that's how you're going to make the  money.  what i'm talking about here is day trading.    my father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30k and down 30k. in the long term of 5-10 years  he makes money.   the day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of xyz for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  he acts quickly, taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours, sometimes within minutes.    i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it.  it's not rocket science, and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training.    the truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money.    popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring.  they don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty  dollars.  they make their money only if you believe two lies:  1) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person.  2) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade.  here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively do not want you to know ...  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying.    after reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, i've learned the following lessons:  ** achieving financial success is incredibly simple.  ** anyone can do it.  ** it only takes a few hours to learn.  when i discovered the secret to day trading, i didn't become wealthy overnight.  if you want instant cash, drive to wal-mart.  buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. the  only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination.  after learning the fundamentals of day trading, i started  practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains.  the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living, and i was pulling close to a six figure income. in less than three years with no  formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, i had made my first million.  the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book, the master trader.  you will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as i teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that i've used profitably year after year.  the income of the day trader can be staggering.  thousands, even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes.  the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this: knowledge.  i will provide that knowledge, and i will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game.   average income of a day trader:  5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year.  27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year  11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year   after reading the master trader, you will discover extremely  profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness.   here is just a snippet of what i will teach you:  *** make money whether a stock goes up or down.   *** learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.   *** learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them.    *** save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make.   *** learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market!    *** learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success.    *** profit on huge intraday price swings.   *** make money on the biggest news stories.   *** actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns.    *** learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use.   *** learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.    it's time to ask yourself: "am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell?  or am i going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money right now in the stock market?"  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy wall street stockbroker, or yourself?  with the master trader e-book, you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading ... from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars.  the master trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight-forward book ever written about active  trading. if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your own financial future.  oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market.    six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the california coast - with cash.  oops, they weren't laughing anymore.  in a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth.  if you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game.  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the master trader e-book right now.  i promise to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.  you don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  it's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.  order the master trader e-book right now for only $49.97 by clicking on the link below:  http://4tools4life.com/qs  ****************************************************** our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails. to be removed from this list, please send an email to "bulkexpert@yahoo.com" ******************************************************  0283ptfl6-774bfbm7392dpuv0-307vjsm4803zjlu1-614iikt2570jdkt6-854fhda5838oell71

spam,attn:  i am edward mulete jr. the son of mr.   steve mbeki mulete from zimbabwe. i am sorry this mail will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother mrs. clara  got your contact through her private search. due to the current war against white farmers in zimbabwe and the support of president robert mugabe to claim all white owned farms in our country to gain favor for re-election.  all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president idea. he then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. they killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm. after the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. the will  documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as  personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could easily be found by his enemies. the total amount is us$21.5m.we are therefore soliciting for your assistance to help us move the fund out of zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from reality, hence this mail to you. the president's present ban of international press into zimbabwe and the drop from office of the  finance minister to avoid giving white farmers fund transfer clearance above us$1m is just a few of the unthinkable things he is committing in my country. i have tried to reach my father's close friend mr. john casahans from australia also a farmer who was leaving in zimbabwe with us but left with his family late last year following this ugly development to no avail. should you be interested to help us, contact me immediately via email for easy communication and i will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction. we have concluded a wonderful plan of  caring out the transfer within two weeks. please note that  this transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will  not endanger you or us in any way. we have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any account of your choice were the incident of taxation will not take much tool on the money and we look forward to coming over to your country to invest our share and settle there. i will a private phone so that our conversation can be 100% confidential.  please do not use the reply button, reply only to   edmulete7@netscape.net please take note.  god bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.  mr. edward mulete      --  irish linux users' group social events: social@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

10th floor new york, new york 10018 phoe: 646.473.2222 the online content business.                                dear friends,    the online content business is doing fantastic.      sound crazy? perhaps.  with  advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying off staff and pulling back on their offerings.      however,  this horrible environment has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging people to pay for content.  finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.  u.s.  consumers spent $675 millionon paidonline content last year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to online publishers association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially this year.  look at these success stories:                     new york times digital has  been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and  registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.                  thestreet.com brought over  $3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent  over the year-ago quarter.                  consumerreports.com will  reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.                  realnetworks' consumer multi-media  subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8  million in the last quarter.                  the wall street journal online added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber base to 646,000.                  ft.com has signed up 17,000  subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in may.            in recognition of this trend we're hosting  the third installation of our innovative content management summit on october 10,  2002.  the event charts the changes in the content industry from free  to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.      our previous content management  summit (aka digital rights summit) on october 18 last year in new york city  and january 29 in los angeles were unqualified successes.      the content management summit  iii,  taking place in new york at the millennium broadway on october 10,  2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and  distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical  solutions.      the event will feature presentations  from software and services companies providing services and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.      we're thrilled that  microsoft,  teleknowledge,  emeta,  and liquify will all be demonstrating  their latest products and services.      the event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.  these panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  the panels will feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive question and answer session with the audience.      among the round table topics will be:                     weblogs:  how they are affecting big media  companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.                  financial news and information  companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users,  and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.                  business information services  such as hoovers,  lexis-nexis and others:  best practices in the industry,   niche product launches and revenue streams.                  daily news/newspaper companies  publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards paid content and its implications,  among other issues.                  consumer and entertainment  publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content,   the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.            join us on october

spam, ilug ,   from;mr.michael kamah and family,           johannesburg,south africa.  my dear ,  good day.this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.  my name is mr.michael kamah, the second son of mr.smith  kamah, of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and ! confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.  during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugabe's!  regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.  now this is what i actually want you to do for me;  1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years.   please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.  best regards,   mr.michael kamah and family.           --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

spam,from: col. michael bundu.  democratic republic of congo.  tel no: your country intl. access code +8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com dear sir/madam   seeking your immediate assistance.   please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a  dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence  and pray that you view it seriously. my name is col. michael bundu of the democratic republic of congo and one of  the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may  his soul rest in peace.   due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country, i and some of my colleagues were  instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred  thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. we were then given this money privately  by the then president, laurent kabila, without the knowledge of other cabinet members. but when president kabila  was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo, we  immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping. the security of the  said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava  (one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military personnel from our same tribe, by the new  president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president laurent kabila, joseph kabila.   in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country  as the beneficiary.  we have sufficient ''contacts'' here to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in europe in your  name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.   our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends  (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila, immediately  after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate  who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will  be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. the said money is a state fund and  therefore requires a total confidentiality.   we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in europe. this is because we are under  restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked  so hard for. thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of congo, you can contact me through my email  addresses, tel/fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the  modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.  please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone's security is guaranteed if we follow the required  guidelines. i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist  us.   i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily  confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. thank you and god bless.  best regards    col. michael bundu(rtd). m_bundu@rediffmail.com  n\b. when you are calling my line, you dial your country intl. access code, then you dial directly, do not include my country  code i.e. (243). just dial your country intl. access code + 88216 52098236. you can also contact me through the above  email addresses.        --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

spam,hello  you may have seen this business before and ignored it. i know i did - many times! however, please take a few moments to read this letter. i was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works!

================================================== be an internet millionaire like others within a year!!!  before you say "bull", please read the following. this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.  their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".  due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained, it is currently working better than ever.  this is what one had to say: "thanks to this profitable opportunity. i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it. i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. to my astonishment, i received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."  pam hedland, fort lee, new jersey. ================================================== another said: "this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it. but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $25 on it. i followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. first month i only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of $290,000.00. so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, i have made over $710,000.00 and i am playing it again. the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything."  more testimonials later but first, =======  ==== print this now for your future reference ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  if you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...then read it again and again!!!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true, guaranteed!  instructions:  =====order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====  for each report, send $5 cash, the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report. make sure your return address is on  your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems.  ===when you place your order, make sure === ===you order each of the 5 reports! === you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. your total cost $5 x 5 = $25.00.  within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it.   remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work!!! people have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. but it does not work this way. believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed. because if you do, it will not work for you. remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!   this is a legitimate business. you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time.  1.. after you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5. this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.  2.. move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5.  3.. move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4.  4.. move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3.  5.. move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6.... insert your name & address in the report # 1 position.  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately! this is critical to your success.  ================================================== **** take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. do not make any other changes.  save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. to assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:  method # 1: by sending bulk e-mail legally ==================================================  let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each.  continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. that's 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2.  those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3.  those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. the 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for report # 4.  those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. the 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for report # 5.  that's 100,000 orders times $5 each = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).  your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... grand total=$555,550.00  numbers do not lie. get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! ==================================================  remember friend, this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5,000 you mailed to. dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. believe me, many people will do just that, and more!  method # 2: by placing free ads on the internet ==================================================  advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise. placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along. for every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. that's it. always provide same day service on all orders.  this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.  ===========available reports ==================== the reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or somehow "wrong". it is simply about time. time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.  order each report by its number & name only. notes: always send $5 cash (u.s. currency) for each report. checks not accepted. make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. on one of those sheets of paper, write the number & the name of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address and your name and postal address.  place your order for these reports now : ==================================================   report # 1: "the insider's guide to advertising for free on the net"  order report #: 1 from rui sousa santos p.o. box 132 taylors lakes vic  3038 australia  ______________________________________________________  report # 2: "the insider's guide to sending bulk email on the net"  order report # 2 from:  richard moulton p.o. box 82 hot springs,mt 59845 usa  ___________________________________________________  report # 3: "secret to multilevel marketing on the net"  order report # 3 from:  j.siden krondikesv gen 54 a 83147  stersund sweden  _____________________________________________________  report # 4: "how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net"  order report # 4 from:  francis kidd p.o. box 209 homestead,pa 15120 usa  __________________________________________________  report # 5: "how to send out one million emails for free"  order report # 5 from:  m.j. lee p.o. box 19 52 victoria drive london sw19 6bd united kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ your success guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:  === if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.  === after you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2. if you do not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.  ** once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, you can relax, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember: every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. if you want to generate more income send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again. there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= following is a note from the originator of this program:  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. follow the program exactly as instructed. do not change it in any way. it works exceedingly well as it is now.  remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. one of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.   remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. so my friend, i have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent.  it is up to you now !  =============more testimonials=============== "my name is mitchell. my wife, jody and i live in chicago. i am an accountant with a major u.s. corporation and i make pretty good money. when i received this program i grumbled to jody about receiving 'junk mail'. i made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. i 'knew' it wouldn't work. jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. i made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'i told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.   well, the laugh was on me! within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! i was shocked. i have joined jody in her 'hobby'."  mitchell wolf m.d., chicago, illinois ================================================ "not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. but conservative as i am, i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. i made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.   the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. there simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."  dan sondstrom, alberta, canada ================================================= "i had received this program before. i deleted it, but later i wondered if i should have given it a try. of course, i had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so i had to wait until i was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... i did not delete this one! i made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."  susan de suza, new york, n.y. ================================================= "it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. i followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. my first month i made $20, in the 2nd month i made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. life is beautiful, thanx to internet."  fred dellaca, westport, new zealand =================================================  order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom !

spam,hi,  i'm a college dropout.  i work about two hours a day.   i'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and i make over  $250,000 a year.  are you curious yet?  in a minute i'm going to tell you my secret, it's the dirty little secret of the internet ...  you've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online, but you thought they  were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or boy-geniuses.  well, grasshopper, think again ...  it's people like you and me that are making the real money.  yep, people like you and me!  ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune 500  companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.  today small business owners and ordinary folks  like you and me can use the web to achieve complete  financial freedom with no investment and very little  work.  how?  by learning the most profitable marketing  technique ever created - it's called bulk email.  if you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then  you know what bulk email is.  i bet you can't click on  delete fast enough for most of those ads, right? you might not want their product, but remember that  thousands of other folks probably do.  bulk email is a  percentage game - every bulker who contacts you  makes a six figure income on the internet.  i  guarantee it.  now let's go back to math 101 and  review some numbers ...  if you sell on ebay, you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction.  how many people see your ad?  maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days.  using bulk email, you can send your ad to more than a million people a day at virtually no cost.  whether your send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. zero!  stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad!  imagine that you have a decent product with a  profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  if you send  an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person  in a thousand actually places an order, then you just  generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours  of work.    it's that simple ...  all you have to do is convince one person out of a thousand to buy your stuff and you're filthy rich.  the best thing is that anyone can do it.  doesn't  matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student  using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old  executive working from an office building in new  york city.  anyone, and i repeat anyone, can start  bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  all  it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition,  and some basic familiarity with the internet.  i quit college when i was 19 to capitalize on the  "dot com" mania, and i've never looked back.  i  started with no money, no product to sell, and only  the most rudimentary computer skills.  i saw an  opportunity and i seized it.  a few years later,  i bought my own home - with cash.    you don't need any money.  you don't need a product. you don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.    if you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it.  it would be a dream come true. so what are you waiting for?!  i'm going to ask you four simple questions.  if you answer yes to all of them, then i can almost promise that you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.  here goes ...  do you have basic experience with the web?  do you have a computer and an internet connection? do you have a few hours each day of free time?   do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards  complete financial freedom?    if you answer yes to these questions, you could be making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your  home.  kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats  the 9-5 daily grind!  all you need is ambition and commitment.  this is no "get rich quick scheme".  you have to work to make big bucks, but anyone - and i mean anyone - can do  it.  you're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.   don't worry, it's not! i will show you step-by-step  how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business.  you'll be generating  orders - and making money - in less than seven days.  okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?  no problem!!  i'll show you where to find hot products that sell like craaaaaazy! most people delay starting an internet business because they have  nothing to sell, but i'm removing that hurdle right now.   after reading the bulkbook, you can build your complete  product line in less than two hours!  there is no excuse  not to get started! i will get you up-and-running within  seven days. in fact ...  i personally guarantee that you will start your own  bulk email campaign less than a week after reading  the bulkbook!  i'll give you a toll-free phone number  to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week;  where else will you find that level of service?!  i will also include a step-by-step guide to starting  your very first email campaign called "seven days to  bulk email success".  this seperate guide contains a daily  routine for you to follow with specific, exact  instructions on how to get started.  on day one, for  example, i teach you where to find a product to sell.  the next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing  list.  on the seventh day, you just click send!  your  very first campaign is ready to go.  as a special bonus, you'll recieve a free copy  of our stealth mass mailer, a very powerful bulk  email program which retails for $49.99! i'll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely free if you order now!  stop wasting your money on auction listing fees,  classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and  never will!  if you are serious about making money  on the internet, bulk email is your only option.   what are you waiting for?  few of us are willing  to share this knowledge, but i promise to teach  you everything i know about bulk emailing in this  extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... the bulkbook!   once again, here's the deal.  you give me $29.99.   i give you all the tools you need to become a successful, high profit bulk emailer.  including:  ** the bulkbook teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit bulk emailer.  secret techniques and tips never before revealed.  ** seven days to bulk email success provides detailed day-by-day instruction to start sending your first email campaign in seven days.  ** 600 email subjects that pull like crazy  ** email list manager manage your email lists quickly and easily.  very  user-friendly, yet powerful, software.  ** stealth mass mailer software can send up to 50,000 emails an hour automatically. just load them in there and click send!  ** address rover 98 and macrobot search engine robot extracts email addresses from databases and search engines at speeds of over 200,000 per hour.  ** worldcast email verifier used to verify your email addresses that you extract to  make sure they're valid.  ** ebook publisher easily publish your own e-books and reports for resale using, you guessed it, bulk email!  ** seven million email addresses this huge list will get you started bulking right away. i harvested these addresses myself, the list is filled with impulse buyers ready to respond to your ads!  if you added up all of the full version bulk email software included with the bulkbook package, it would total over $499.  i am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99. that means there is no other out-of-pocket startup expense for you.  nothing else to buy, no reason to waste money on software that doesn't work.  with this one package, you get  everything you need to start bulk emailing right away.    are you willing to invest $29.99 for the opportunity to make a six figure income on the internet with no  startup cash and very little effort?

spam,================this is definitely the answer we all have been waiting for===============  every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. when you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why i'm writing you today. although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, i would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any mlm (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit multi-level marketing. with a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner.    the truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, i'm just going to make you a very simple offer. email me with 'send link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and i will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. you can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. this isn't a trick, i'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that i don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. with an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. if you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. thank you for your time, and i hope you discover why we're all smiling!!   please do not treat this message as spam. i am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. i was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. i have not used this means of marketing before and frankly i am dubious about its validity. however, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it i'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. if you want more information i will happily supply the link without any obligation. but if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. as this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. thank you.

easy_ham,man threatens explosion in moscow   thursday august 22, 2002 1:40 pm moscow (ap) - security officers on thursday seized an unidentified man who said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in front of russia's federal security services headquarters in moscow, ntv television reported. the officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody, ntv said. no other details were immediately available. the man had demanded talks with high government officials, the interfax and itar-tass news agencies said. ekho moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with russian president vladimir putin. police and security forces rushed to the security service building, within blocks of the kremlin, red square and the bolshoi ballet, and surrounded the man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news agencies said. negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building, itar-tass and interfax reported, citing witnesses. the man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove to a street near moscow's olympic penta hotel, where authorities held further negotiations with him, the moscow police press service said. the move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more secure location.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mg3haa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,klez: the virus that won't die   already the most prolific virus ever, klez continues to wreak havoc.  andrew brandt from the september 2002 issue of pc world magazine posted thursday, august 01, 2002   the klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across  the web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. and  experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a  combination of pernicious approaches to go from pc to pc.  antivirus software makers symantec and mcafee both report more than  2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. the  british security firm messagelabs estimates that 1 in every 300  e-mail messages holds a variation of the klez virus, and says that  klez has already surpassed last summer's sircam as the most prolific  virus ever.  and some newer klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry  other viruses in them that corrupt your data.  ...  http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,103259,00.asp _______________________________________________ irregulars mailing list irregulars@tb.tf http://tb.tf/mailman/listinfo/irregulars

easy_ham,the scotsman - 22 august 2002   playboy wants to go out with a bang       an ageing berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into  his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000  ( 160,000).     rolf eden, 72, a berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,  said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive  young woman - preferably under 30.     "i put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with  me gets all the money," mr eden told bild newspaper.     "i want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. first a lot of  fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all  end with a heart attack and then i m gone."     mr eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be  sent in quickly because of his age. "it could end very soon," he said.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mg3haa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,the scotsman   thu 22 aug 2002    meaningful sentences     tracey lawson       if you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison  history", as one judge described charles bronson, now s your chance. bronson -  the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and  fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary  muscle power.     solitary fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that bronson, 48,  has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he  has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a  day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at  virtually no cost.     the book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a  fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and  starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the  exercise industry.     "i pick up a fitness mag, i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it," is the  opening paragraph penned by bronson. "it s a joke and a big con and they call  me a criminal!" you can t help feeling he has a point.     this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars, having  already published birdman opens his mind, which features drawings and poems  created by bronson while in prison. and he is not the first prisoner to  discover creative expression while residing at her majesty s pleasure.     jimmy boyle, the scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents  when he was sent to barlinnie prison s famous special unit, which aimed to  help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to  express their emotions artistically. boyle was sentenced to life for the  murder of "babs" rooney in 1967. once released, he moved to edinburgh where he  has become a respected artist. his first novel, hero of the underworld, was  published in 1999 and his autobiography, a sense of freedom, was made into an  award-winning film.     hugh collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of william mooney in  glasgow, and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison  officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. but, after being  transferred to the same unit that boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and  developed an interest in art. he later published autobiography of a murderer,  a frank account of glasgow s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received  critical praise.     and lord archer doesn t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books  that have made him millions while in jail. he recently signed a three-book  deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported  10 million, and is no doubt  scribbling away as we speak.     so why is it that men like collins, bronson and boyle, who can be so  destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck  on the inside? steve richards, bronson s publisher, has published many books  about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both  pragmatic and profound.     he says: "prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have  known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the  chance to focus on their creative skills.     "it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an  education, if their early years have been hard. it could be the first time  anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."     however, richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. he says:  "once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine  the very essence of who they are.     "they ask themselves, am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence? or  am i a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something  good?"     bronson - who was born michael gordon peterson, but changed his name to that  of the hollywood star of the death wish films - has, so far, been remembered  mainly for things bad. he was originally jailed for seven years for armed  robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term  over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. in 2000 he was  jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly  two days during a jail siege.     standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is  renowned for his strength. he has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands  and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. as he puts it: "i can hit  a man 20 times in four seconds, i can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."     but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, solitary  fitness might be the book which will see bronson s face sitting on every  coffee table in the land. he might be the man to give us the dream body which  so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. because  bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists.     "all this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it s just a load of  bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be  described as a refreshingly honest style. "we can all be fat lazy bastards,  it s our choice, i m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff  your face with shit you become shit, that s logical to me."     as motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside  we all needed.       solitary fitness by charles bronson is published by mirage publishing and will  be available in bookstores from october at  7.99   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mg3haa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,spamassassin is hurting democracy! owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm  internet can level the political playing field by mike mccurry and larry purpuro  not many months from now, people across the country will experience one  of the great recurring features of american democracy. at shopping  malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front  stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in  public office. while chances are high that we won't know them  personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and  ask for our votes.  just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it  has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.  in this year's gop gubernatorial primary, california secretary of state  bill jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail  addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent  each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.  that day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more  expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio  spots or tv ads. but he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of  35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.  had jones chosen direct mail, radio or tv, that communication would have  been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. few voters  would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from jones  through any of those channels.  the response to jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. he  was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost  entirely negative. to be fair, some of jones' tactics could have been  refined. he used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice  ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.  his detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but  because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. in fact, jones' online campaign  may have been his most visible asset. in an era of cynicism toward money  in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication  mediums -- jones tried to level the playing field.  no one likes commercial spam. it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be  highly intrusive and even offensive. but as a sophisticated society,  it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different  unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.  the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress  that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. we  believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or  tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. a  simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of  future mailings. direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be  taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads.  when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the  internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them  to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. with more than 60  percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail  accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.  candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the  jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better  ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient  groups.  but the broader point remains. when a political candidate sends a voter  an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without  opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage  the sender. that choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam  advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.  political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best  they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- mike mccurry, former press secretary for president clinton, is ceo of an  advocacy management and communications software company. larry purpuro,  the former republican national committee deputy chief of staff, is  founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. this was written  for the los angeles times.   http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

easy_ham,                                   you have multiple generations of  peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a  human parts of the property package.  when i'd read that "getting legal title can take 20 years", when i believe that 1 year ought to be more than sufficient, (and helped by the cairo reference) i'd assumed that we were talking about the urban poor.  if i see people living in mansions, or even in suburban subdivisions, i assume they didn't have too much trouble with their titles.  if i see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways, i tend to assume their parcels weren't exactly recorded on the government maps, or paid for with a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them "development" free.  now, it may be that "manhattanites' view of america" to say that outside of metro manila, davao, and maybe another city or two (cebu?), everything else (literally) is the boondocks.  but going on that very broad assumption, i guess i'm describing the flip side of mr. roger's experience: the paisanos (who leave behind those who remain on a patron's rural land) move to manila, and (the second assumption) squat in shantytowns there, at least until they can line up a middle-class job.  so, going on two large assumptions, i can come up with a scenario under which title would take 20 years: a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section (or whatever the spanish used to divvy up the land) and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants.  just transferring title to an existing lot, between parties who have money, ought not to be a problem.  the obvious solution, at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on fork, is to "introduce market mechanisms".  it is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents (are perceived to) have negligible npv.  -dave                [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had  to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...  what happened to more highly-capitalized land?  putting in trees instead of crops sounds like it might sidestep that.   mr. long, i think you'd particularly enjoy the de soto work.  on the "to find" list.  any chance of an explanation of that "bell jar" in the meantime?  http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  
easy_ham,hi everybody!  i'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgresql).  this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.  the application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.  i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but i have some problem figuring out the right approach.  above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.  a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. the api that i'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always.   i can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, i can use a different database with different  user... argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.  where i can found good documentation about this topic?  there is another approach that i would share with the list, something i  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  after all, i'm a real beginner in secure programming, and i'm here to  learn methods and technics.  first of all, i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  i have to keep them separate from the main server. the right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.  the web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. the small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.  in this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. this is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).  any suggestions?  thank you, mario torre --  please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments. see http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html

easy_ham,folks,   my first time posting - have a bit of unix experience, but am new to linux.    just got a new pc at home - dell box with windows xp. added a second hard disk for linux. partitioned the disk and have installed suse 7.2 from cd, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.   i have a dell branded e151fpp 15" lcd flat panel monitor and a nvidia geforce4 ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in suse's default set. i downloaded a driver from the nvidia website and installed it using rpm. then i ran sax2 (as was recommended in some postings i found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. what next?   another problem. i have a dell branded keyboard and if i hit caps-lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in linux, not windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.   if anyone can help me in any way with these probs., i'd be really grateful - i've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.   or should i be going for a different version of linux such as redhat? opinions welcome.   thanks a lot, peter  --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

[why was it that] a significant rate of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the whole market economy of the time? ... it would perhaps be teasingly paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent country residents built ... [how do we] resolve the contradiction ... between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of florence under lorenzo the magnificent?    --------------  de soto's theory is that the bell jar is formed when you segregate those who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do not.  the poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  what they don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital and allow it to start growing.  their property can only be exchanged with a small section of people who know them personally.

"the problem with the french," bush afterwards confided in blair, "is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."  the source was shirley williams, also known as the baroness williams of crosby, who claimed "my good friend tony blair" had recently regaled her with this anecdote in brighton.  lloyd grove of the washington post was unable to reach baroness williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did receive a call from alastair campbell, blair's director of communications and strategy. "i can tell you that the prime minister never heard george bush say that, and he certainly never told shirley williams that president bush did say it," campbell told the post. "if she put this in a speech, it must have been a joke."  this is far from the first time bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've chronicled on this site. in the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of presidential iqs, with george w. bush being pegged as the chief executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. in december 2000 it was a fake nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win the 2000 presidential election. and in the spring of 2002, it was the story of bush's waving at stevie wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves.  stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after george w. bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever been. it is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears.  barbara "ears of corn" mikkelson  last updated:   29 july 2002  http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"we have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before  everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.  opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or  allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political  messages while remaining anonymous.  biersack said the fec can revisit the issue if those problems surface.  target wireless president craig krueger characterized the opinion as  "good for america."  "it will allow people to receive more communication from those running  for office," he said. "we have free speech on our side."

easy_ham, xvid [1] is a project to make gpl divx codecs. sigma designs [1] is a company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things, divx files. problem is sigma is using xvids gpled code in ways not very gpl. the  results....xvid stops work on thier code and ask the users to put preasure  on sigma to honor the gpl.  some notes from other places....  from doom9 [3] "xvid development has been stopped! the sigma designs realmagic mpeg-4 video codec contains wide portions of code taken from the xvid project. soon after the initial release of the realmagic codec the xvid developers have contacted sigma and informed them about the gpl violation (for those who don't know, xvid is distributed under the gnu public license - gpl - which demands that if you modify a gpl program you have to release it under the gpl, which in this case means that the source code of the sigma codec must be freely available). sigma promised to replace the stolen code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. sigma was once again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today nothing has happened. therefore the xvid team is now turning to the public in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince sigma designs to respect the terms of the gpl. and until the matter has been resolved xvid development will not continue.  that being said i hope all the forum members who saw their threads about the sigma codecs being closed will understand our motivation now. internally we already knew what was going on but since the xvid authors first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes and kept quiet about the matter at hand.  [update] sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of the source code of their mpeg-4 codec and it's already up for download. however, not a word was lost about the xvid issue and the press release makes one think that the sigma codec was entirely developed by sigma so we might be hearing more about this.  [update] i found a gpl notice in some of the source code files, but it also looks like sigma placed their own copyright lines there and xvid doesn't get any credit in the source either. the gpl notice also collides with sigma's software licensing agreement that you have to sign before downloading codec or source. on on the same issue divxnetworks said they'd fully support xvid in this issue and apparently dxn's relationship with sigma didn't really work out either, as sigma's xcard is not as divx compatible as it was advertised.  [update]first an update on the xvid situation. the release of the sigma source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. the license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and install the codec is not compatible with the gpl. furthermore, it can now clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself) that the sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the xvid codec, but all the copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and replaced. this does not only violate the gpl but copyright laws - you can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on your own. and related to this the sigma codec also contains code taken from the opendivx project, the files were outfitted with 2 different copyright notices which is quite funny."

easy_ham,from http://www.arstechnica.com/  "there has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the department of justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted material over the internet. deputy assistant attorney general john malcolm believes that "criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of america's content industries." malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity. i certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works.   "some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...i think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution," said [riaa president cary] sherman, who was on the same conference panel.  i'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect sherman is hoping for. although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the riaa and may be difficult to initiate because of the "schooling" effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing. only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd.  the article cites the no electronic theft (net) act [2], which defines illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:   criminal infringement: any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000.... for purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement. ... the term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.   therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as "financial gain" even if no money is involved. the net act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.  the statute of limitations:   507. limitations on actions  (a) criminal proceedings.--no criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose.  (b) civil actions.--no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.  the penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in section 2319: criminal infringement of a copyright. in general, first-time criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.  i'm still not sure where the doj would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned "schooling" effect, but my guess would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. thanks to monalisaoverdrive for pointing out this story.

easy_ham,i need to setup a vpn between a few sites. from what i've read, the the choices come down (on the linux side) to ipsec (using freeswan) or cipe. it seems that freeswan is 'better', being an implementation of ipsec which is a standard. however, cipe does the job as well for linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup.   the problem is that it's not a pure linux situation - a couple of the sites run os-x. i'm pretty sure that i'll be able to find an implementation of ipsec for os-x, but i think cipe is linux only.  so, the question is for those of you have have implemented both - is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between cipe and freeswan ? if cipe is going to be much easier than dealing with freeswan (and whatever on the os-x sites) then i'll simply get a linux box for each of the remote sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.    niall  --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

easy_ham,here's a weird and wacky problem:  i'm currently out of the country with my trusty evo n600c laptop. when i  tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, linux behaved  pretty much as if the port was fried. bizarre, i thought, because i'd  used it successfully while in the office. the only difference was that i  was trying the thing in the hotel. i entertained brief notions of having  somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to windows  and tried again. worked perfectly. back to linux. still not talking.  considered that it might be flaky power, so i ran the laptop on battery.  nope. tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where  there might be less bogon flux. still not working. eventually i gave up  and used the irda port instead - which is usually the serial connection  of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.  this morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.  anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel  that prevents serial ports from working under linux?  cheers, waider. --  waider@waider.ie / yes, it /is/ very personal of me  --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

easy_ham,ananova:   man admits soham kidnapping hoax calls  a man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the disappearance of soham schoolgirls jessica chapman and holly wells. wrexham magistrates court, in north wales, heard jobless howard youde made three calls to police in cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the youngsters. he was arrested in wrexham in the early hours of august 16 when officers traced the call to a phone box on the town's brook street. the 45-year-old, of queensway, hope, near wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one count of wasting police time on august 15 this year. the court was told youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls having been drinking all day. defence lawyer mark arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor calculated but added that this was no excuse. he said: "what he's done is horrific. it's unforgivable. the distress he's caused the families is unacceptable." youde has been released on unconditional bail until november 7 when he will be sentenced. the hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the defendant has been warned custody is an option. story filed: 12:36 monday 7th october 2002  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,from the bbc website - www.bbc.co.uk   tuesday, 8 october, 2002, 09:43 gmt 10:43 uk    fake bank website cons victims    west african criminals have used a fake version of a british bank's online  service to milk victims of cash, say police. the fake site was used to squeeze  more money out of people they had already hooked.     the site has been shut down. but uk national criminal intelligence service,  (ncis), said at least two canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being  taken in by the fake website.     the scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a  share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various african  nations.     ncis said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would  otherwise spot the scam.     convincing site     news of this latest scam was revealed by bbc radio5live. it found that an  unclaimed web domain of a uk bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out  their victims.    a ncis spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in  front of the bank's name.     "i have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated," said the ncis  spokesman. "it's very convincing especially to people not very experienced  online."     once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. however, the people  behind it have not been caught.     ncis does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000.     the bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many  other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again.    domain games     usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as advanced fee or  419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any  cash successfully moved out of africa.     the '419' refers to the part of the nigerian penal code dealing with such  crimes.     like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking  the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe  uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash.     although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to  it.     ncis estimates that up to five americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in  london everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con.     cutting edge fraud     often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of  legitimacy.       people tricked into clicking on fake sites    but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in  place of the certificates.     "to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web  technology," said the spokesman.     one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website  that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african  reserve bank, the country's national bank.     typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to  visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has  been deposited in their name.     but before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically  asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead.     once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national  priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it.     modern gloss     an briefing paper prepared by ncis in august on organised crime noted that  criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give  old cons a modern gloss.     the ncis spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come  forward and help it track down the perpetrators. he said in the last two  months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud.     he said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be  true, undoubtedly is.     one of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment  service paypal.     conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account  and credit card details because paypal had lost the information.     the website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed  people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.    ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- sell a home for top $ http://us.click.yahoo.com/rrpzmc/jtmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

'deserved death' chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if chapman were released. lennon's songwriting partnership with paul mccartney propelled the liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. the beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would have been 62 on wednesday.  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/story/0,2763,806744,00.html  evangelicals' threat to new archbishop  direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality  stephen bates, religious affairs correspondent tuesday october 8, 2002 the guardian  evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust rowan williams, the incoming archbishop of canterbury, before he even takes up his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him. the council of the church society, the church of england's oldest evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called reform, which is also opposed to dr williams, in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down. following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all anglicans to spurn him. the move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement. some evangelicals object to dr williams's acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. the new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church. nevertheless, the society said: "it is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church. as such he can only be a focus of disunity. "the council... called upon loyal anglicans to pray specifically that rowan williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand down," it said. the society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide anglican communion, of which archbishops of canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from dr williams's doctrinal and ethical position. it promised it would be "taking steps towards appropriate direct action". it added that dr williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called theology and sexuality which, six months ago, published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour. despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the church. dr williams, currently archbishop of wales, was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the queen. he is due to succeed george carey, who retires this month, and will be formally enthroned at canterbury cathedral in february. asked what form direct action might take, the rev george curry, the society's chairman, said: "watch this space." presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where dr williams is present. church of england bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal. a letter by senior theologians in today's guardian, however, repudiates the evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching. on the bbc's thought for the day yesterday, angela tilby, vice-principal of westcott house, cambridge, accused dr williams's opponents of presumption and blackmail. "it is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. it is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said. last week, dr williams said he was deeply saddened. "matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that reform and the church society have tried to give them. the archbishop cannot withdraw his appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under god."   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.html  weevil pest warms to life in south-west london  james meek, science correspondent tuesday october 8, 2002 the guardian  they're chomping in chelsea, fulham and pimlico, but despite their fancy taste in london addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants. two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive britain's cold winters have been discovered in south-west london, and one has also been detected in surrey, cardiff and edinburgh. "this is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," said max barclay, the curator of beetles at the natural history museum in london who discovered the creatures in the uk. the black vine weevil has long been native to britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. but the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of switzerland, are now prevalent in south london. "it's very likely these weevils have been introduced to britain through imported ornamental plants from italy," said dr barclay. "it looks like they're here to stay." he found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. it has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in south-west london. the second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. an early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. the soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. one possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of britain is global warming. earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,nobel honors 3 for astrophysics work   tuesday october 8, 2002 12:00 pm stockholm, sweden (ap) - two americans and a japanese won the nobel prize in physics tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders. riccardo giacconi, 71, of the associated universities inc. in washington, d.c., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic x-ray sources.'' raymond davis, jr., 87, of the university of pennsylvania shares the other half of the prize with japanese scientist masatoshi koshiba, 76, of the university of tokyo. the two men pioneered the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from the sun by the billion. neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine. in fact, davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a south dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion. koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the kamiokande neutrino detector in japan. that experiment confirmed and extended davis' work, and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of the brightest objects in the universe. the italian-born giacconi, a u.s. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for building the first x-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said. his research laid the foundation for x-ray astronomy, which has led to the discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born. when academy officials reached giacconi by phone at his home outside washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. koshiba also was phoned at home in tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach davis, spokesman erling norrby said. this year's nobel awards started monday with the naming of britons sydney brenner, 75, and sir john e. sulston, 60, and american h. robert horvitz, 55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the karolinska institute. the researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as aids, strokes, cancer and heart attacks. the winner of the nobel prize in chemistry will be named on wednesday morning and the bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel later the same day. the literature prize winner will be announced on thursday, the swedish academy said on tuesday. the winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in sweden - will be announced friday in oslo, norway. the award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are not publicly revealed for 50 years. alfred nobel, the wealthy swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees. in his will he said the prize being revealed on tuesday should be given to those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and ``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics.'' the royal swedish academy of sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts in the fields before cutting down its choices. deliberations are conducted in strict secrecy. the prizes are presented on dec. 10, the anniversary of nobel's death in 1896, in stockholm and in oslo. --- on the net: nobel site, http://www.nobel.se   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.html  lioness adopts fifth antelope  rory carroll, africa correspondent tuesday october 8, 2002 the guardian  kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled wildlife experts. the young lioness in the samburu national park in northern kenay adopted her latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday. each time kamuniak, whose name means "the blessed one" in the local samburu tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed the natural mothers to feed them. unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers. the wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed naisimari ("taken by force"), was adopted at the weekend. "she must have adopted her on sunday because they are in harmony," said gabriel lepariyo, a warden. naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a distance. theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, kamuniak is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour and confusing the hunter; kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; kamuniak wants to be loved.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- sell a home with ease! http://us.click.yahoo.com/srpzmc/ktmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,ananova:   dracula theme park could be switched to bucharest  a controversial scheme to build a dracula theme park in romania could be switched away from transylvania. consultants pricewaterhousecoopers is now recommending that it be built in bucharest instead. it comes after prince charles led international protests against the original proposals to build it in the medieval town of sigishoara. pricewaterhousecoopers name bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the project. but that has angered residents in sigishoara, where vlad the impaler, the inspiration for dracula, was born. they are counting on the park to boost the local economy. evenimentul zilei reports that sigishoara was placed behind the capital with the black sea port of constanta third choice. dorin danesan, mayor of sigishoara, said: "the pre-feasibility report from pwc shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in bucharest. but i still think that sigishoara is the best location for it." the park would include hotels, a dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a reconstruction of dracula's castle and an artificial lake. the project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation unesco fearing sigishoara might be spoilt. pricewaterhousecoopers is to present its final report on the project on october 15. story filed: 13:16 tuesday 8th october 2002  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,ananova:   newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption  readers of an african newspaper have complained after a picture caption about jewellery contained the words "let's have sex". the mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages spoken in namibia. callers to the namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which translates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the oshiwambo language. it was used in a caption concerning people in the caprivi who use rings from the femidon - female condom - as jewellery. according to the the namibian , an activist involved in care for aids/hiv patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist. he intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the siyeyi tongue. one caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people's languages. it is very clear that the picture was taken in the caprivi ...and that the word is from siyeyi. it is not oshiwambo". others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various namibian languages, such as omakende, an oshiwambo word for glasses which in siyeyi means testicles. another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in oshiwambo translates as let's talk, but which in sisubiya translates as let's have intercourse. the herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an oshiwambo word for a vagina. story filed: 12:37 tuesday 8th october 2002  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

(we hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) when bush gets the report on tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 taft-hartley act. that would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their xanax dosages. invoking taft-hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. but labor secretary elaine chao covered that base in a statement on monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew iraq would be in here somewhere). "union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the l.a. times, but an anonymous bush administration official "said that only a portion of what the defense department needs has made it ashore." politically, this has been a tricky one. using taft-hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. on the other hand, "voter discontent with bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the republican administration," said the san francisco chronicle. also, bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. "though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention," said the ap.  as for taft-hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). one gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. it's 78 days until christmas. the race is on. - jen muehlbauer president acts to halt port lockout for 80 days (seattle times) http://tinyurl.com/1usn  bush expected to act on ports crisis  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html  president moves toward forcing the reopening of west coast ports http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story  bush takes step toward halting lockout after west coast port talks break off (ap) http://tinyurl.com/1usk  white house intervenes on docks dispute (financial times) http://tinyurl.com/1usm  cooling-off period likely in port fight (sf chronicle) http://tinyurl.com/1usp  bush moves toward halting port shutdown http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08port.html  trouble on the docks http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html  (paid subscription required.) charges of politics have dogged taft-hartley act http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/90243_hartley08.shtml  taft-hartley act no quick-fix for port dispute (reuters) http://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2002/10/02/rtr739458.html                                                                                                                          sponsor                                                                                                                      special offer!   save 24% on a subscription to mit technology review. get an inside view into the technologies, deals, and companies emerging from one of the leading research institutes -- mit.  http://www.technologyinsider.com/new/news1                                                                                                                                                                                      the biggest cable hookup                                                                                                                                      wo birds want to join forces and the fcc is about to cry "fowl." we mean "foul." the two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with big cable. federal regulators, both the fcc and the justice department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of directv with dish network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the us. the press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between echostar communications and hughes electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. it was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. hughes is directv and echostar is dish. all straight? the two companies sent a letter to the fcc urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the justice department has spoken. echostar and hughes offered unspecified "major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with justice in the next weeks. the wall street journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to cablevision. the journal reported that cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. thestreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. it seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. thestreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, "consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns." the new york times and the journal both mentioned rupert murdoch waiting in the wings. last year murdoch's news corp. bid for directv, but lost out at the last minute to echostar. if the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - keith dawson echostar and hughes propose concessions in bid to save deal http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,sb103403314258094560,00.html  (paid subscription required) regulators set to block echostar's hughes purchase http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,sb1033939901346228393,00.html  (paid subscription required) 'last-ditch effort' (rocky mountain news) http://tinyurl.com/1upi  echostar, hughes see a glimmer of hope http://www.thestreet.com/tech/georgemannes/10046366.html  f.c.c. asked to put off merger ruling http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/business/media/08bird.html  echostar, hughes ask fcc to defer decision http://www.nypost.com/business/59145.htm  echostar, hughes offer merger changes (reuters)  http://news.com.com/2100-1023-961138.html  delay in satellite-tv merger ok requested (ap) http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/4236430.htm  echostar, hughes seek to delay ruling http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-echo8oct08,0,3454976.story  echostar pleads to fcc on merger (denver post) http://tinyurl.com/1ut7                                                                             other stories                                                                                                                                      sec probes aol-oxygen pact for double-booking of revenue http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,sb1033938113684731193,00.html  (paid subscription required.) tivo raises $25 million in stock offering (ap) http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4235118.htm  worldcom officer pleads guilty to fraud http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/a57300-2002oct7.html  two magazines are shut and a third revamps http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/business/media/08mag.html  regulators say they have csfb 'smoking gun' http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2002-10-06-csfb_x.htm  expected cold winter could increase natural gas prices  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08gas.html  frozen world found beyond pluto http://www.msnbc.com/news/818195.asp  fool me once http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/opinion/08krug.html  new northwest system for internet bookings http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/business/08memo.html  the fastest-growing tech companies http://www.business2.com/b2100/0,,1-1,00.html  debating the baby bells http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/business/07plac.html  (paid subscription required) silicon valley is yearning for user-friendly microsoft http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,sb1034036651300028760,00.html  (paid subscription required)                                                                                                                        sponsor                                                           do you want to reach the net's savviest audience?

easy_ham,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2220132.stm  tuesday, 27 august, 2002, 21:35 gmt 22:35 uk cambodia temple ruins yield treasure  workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in northern cambodia have unearthed 31 buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold. the statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good condition and believed to be hundreds of years old. they were found on saturday as workers were rebuilding the po pich temple about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, phnom penh. the pagoda, in the batay district of kampong thom province, was torn down during the reign of the khmer rouge in the 1970s and the area became overgrown. community care deputy police chief of kampong thom province, hang sithim, said the statues - three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre (3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb). ''i think that these buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago, when the last temple was fully operating," mr hang sithim said. provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the buddhist community at the temple to take care of them. ''we believe they are safe there,'' said som somphat, deputy governor of kampong thom province. ''the people of po pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.'' reign of terror a police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters. the khmer rouge waged civil war in cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and controlled the country between 1975 and 1979. the regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent or culturally impure. about two million people died in the khmer rouge's drive to turn cambodia into a farmers' utopia.    ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,the electronic telegraph   emigrate to russia? that's a steppe too far  (filed: 28/08/2002)       so you think you've got it bad: fed up with folkestone, bored with birmingham  or sick of sheffield.    those 54 per cent of britons - according to a daily telegraph/yougov survey  this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps  heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.    kommersant, a russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied  with life in blair's britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to  emigrate to provincial russia.    after reading about the gripes of affluent britons, its tongue-in-cheek  article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other  side.    "the inhabitants of foggy albion keen to travel could go to any russian city  deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said kommersant.    "in any central russian district, life, by british standards, is unseemingly  cheap and remarkably laid back. by 11am most of the working population are  becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."    the time for elevenses in britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of  tea and a chocolate hobnob - is known in russia as the wolf hour.    it was so named in soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the  famous animal clock at the obrasov puppet theatre in moscow. it is also  opening time in the nation's vodka shops.    and the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. kommersant pointed out that  "the money a briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be  enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their  life.    "the local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle  of whisky for kopecks."    there are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a  halfpenny in sterling.    the whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average briton  will have consumed before. it is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine  vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among  diehard alcoholics.    while alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. the  newspaper pointed out that traditional british foodstuffs - it selected oxtail  soup as an example - were in short supply. however, the wealth of the british  settler should overcome the difficulty.    "for a modest reward in most russian villages, the locals would happily cut  off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."    one or two potential emigr s might be deterred by language difficulties. there  are few english speakers to be found among the green hills of tula on the  mongolian border.    however, kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a  deterrent by the 13 per cent of britons who nominated france as the country in  which they would like to live.    france, the russian paper claimed, was a country "where english is only known  by the beggars, belorussian prostitutes and russian tourists".    despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the russian  weather remains a major stumbling block for britons.    even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20c are common.  and somewhere like the sakha republic - east of siberia and the coldest place  in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures  that drop below -70c. houses are built on concrete stilts because the  permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.    again, the russian paper had a word of reassurance. while acknowledging the  climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will  solve itself".    kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in  britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in russia.    "thirty-three million russians could be sent to britain to replace the 33  million who leave. we think that the required number could probably be found  amongst our citizens."    unfortunately for those 33 million russians, however, not one of those britons  surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the russian steppes as their  preferred new home.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,the electronic telegraph   six arrested for attacking palio jockey who defected   by bruce johnston in rome  (filed: 28/08/2002)       police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the palio, siena's  traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six  people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.      angry spectators attack giuseppe pes at the palio horse race in siena   giuseppe pes, a champion jockey of sardinian extraction who has won the palio  nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the istrice, or porcupine,  contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.    istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take  part in each palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the  off mr pes mounted the horse of lupa, or she-wolf.    lupa are istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. lupa  did not win, victory going instead to tartuca, tortoise.    as its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, mr pes was pulled from his  mount by istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.    mr pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,  was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.    three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. police  yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers  from video footage.    experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as  contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact  that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.    the palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on  the cobbles of siena's main square. for weeks beforehand supporters parade  through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.  but by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.    the event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary  undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. jockeys may swap sides at the last  minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not  grab their reins.    the origins of the contrada lie in the middle ages, when the neighbourhoods'  boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend  siena's fiercely earned independence from florence and other city states.    the first palio of the year takes place on july 2, to commemorate the miracles  of the madonna of provenzano, and a second race on aug 16 marks the feast of  the assumption of the virgin.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html  hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him  rod liddle wednesday august 28, 2002 the guardian  sheikh abu hamza al-masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park, hackney. i've often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays. head for the beach and maybe swing by b&q on the way home, i had hoped. i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins, and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once, instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you, too. but b&q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza's budget since the bank of england froze his assets, so victoria park had to do. but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, islamic proto-warriors in the background. you must know hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the daily mail's cartoonist mac. large metal hook in place of a left hand. one eye covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. we don't mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like hamza whom we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come off. so hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right) as "captain hook", in articles which usually call for his arrest, or extradition to the us, or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan, where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. and if we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him to shut up. because we don't like hamza very much. we weren't that fond of him before september 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political persecution. and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam. all out of context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. but perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror's scoop. hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary finsbury park mosque - so, earlier this year, the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks. i didn't know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that. he has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been frozen. he is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press. and this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly - repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be true - hamza is not "representative" of british muslims, as if british muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation. and perhaps succour. the trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of those government-approved muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, i suspect - dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban. an opinion poll commissioned by radio 4's today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush's crusade. one in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the us (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam. which is what hamza said, repeatedly. but it was something that, at the time, we didn't want to hear. now, if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from the liberal left. no war against iraq; britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states; stronger action against israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth. nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as i can tell, although i don't suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year. in yesterday's guardian, the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh's message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked. which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam: he would be happy, in a truly islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for example. you and i would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly repellent. and that's the point. because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural. multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony. that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism. multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them. the fbi has been investigating hamza, but, of course, has found nothing remotely incriminating. the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views. it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally. this is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash. you don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. and if british muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza. shutting the man up, therefore, won't make a difference. it is rather as louis macneice had it: the glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever. but if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722  pro-hunt activists target top sight  one of yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on white horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate. villagers near thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous white horse of kilburn had acquired a rider during the night. in another incident, the uffington white horse in oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent a celtic god or tribal symbol. pro-hunt activists in the real countryside alliance (rca)   a radical alternative to the better-known countryside alliance   admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images. the 314ft by 228ft landmark at kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster john hodgson and his pupils in 1857. but during monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn   which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet. it was removed yesterday by members of kilburn white horse association, who found a countryside alliance badge attached to the carpet. john roberts of the association said: "it has obviously been very well organised. it was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets. "it was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. they tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down. it caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. it will not get another refit for another year. "whoever did it must have come with a vehicle   a tractor and trailer or a lorry   because the carpet must have come in one piece. it was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off." the sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south of england, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening. mr roberts added: "the damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration, which means it will need more work next time. "we would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to take it away again because it was a major job." andy wilson, chief executive of the north york moors national park, said: "it is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. there is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. there has not been a cut in the turf   which would be much more of a problem. it would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand." an rca spokesman said: "some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction. all we want is ministers to take notice. marches don't seem to be doing anything good." the countryside alliance said it did not have any part in the action. spokesman adrian yelland said: "the countryside alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident." the incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in yorkshire thought to be rca work.  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,no analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. but here's the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... best,  rohit  ===========================================================  datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august 27, 2002 5:46 am pt  datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data. unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software, datapower's device processes the data in  hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance,  according to company officials.  the new device, dubbed datapower xa35 xml accelerator, is the first in a  family of products expected from the cambridge, mass.-based startup. the  datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called xg3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the xml  data.  according to steve kelly, ceo of datapower, the xa35 accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml, the anticipated future  proliferation of web services, and as a means to share data between two  businesses.  "our vision is to build out an xml-aware infrastructure," kelly said.  "the xa35 is the first of a family."  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up  to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers; datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative.  in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml.  "today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only," kelly  said. "a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today."  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.  according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.  "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing -- claims that he believes  will be mostly false. other content-aware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)  accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.  the 1u-high network device has been tested against a large collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device.  the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.  in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application  co-processor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device.  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup  sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in  may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spin-off, launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises.  =========================================================================  datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml  grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class m.i.t. engineers and  designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software  interpreter called dgxt. this software-based approach to xml processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing software-based accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purpose-built hardware. in  2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3 ), the  industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.  today, xg3  technology powers the industry's first wire-speed xml  network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and xml web  services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industry-leading customers and partners.  datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.  =========================================================================  datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding  venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer  in xml-aware networking for web services  cambridge, mass. - july 8, 2002 - datapower technology, inc., the  leading provider of xml-aware network infrastructure, today announced  that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for  this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed  capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius,  and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapower s board of  directors.  datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and  sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml-aware networking.  founded in 1999, datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml  networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions  at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services  and other xml-centric initiatives. datapower s solutions are based on  its patent-pending xml generation three (xg3 ) technology.  "enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and  intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.  datapower s xml-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of  xml that is required to support next generation enterprise  applications," said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower  technology.  "datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web  services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." a single  datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10  servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml  processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in  addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,  protection against xml-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of  e-business protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load balancing  between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.  "in the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require  laser-focused scrutiny. datapower s patent-pending technology addresses  a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said michael  tyrrell of venrock associates. "by turbo-charging their networks with  datapower s unique xml-aware networking technology, companies will be  free to adopt next generation web services without encountering  performance and security pitfalls."  "we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly  growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and  security," said bill burnham of mobius venture capital. "datapower is on  their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml  generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most  compelling technology solution we have seen to date."  "xml is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious  about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999, datapower has been  developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web  services," said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. "datapower s  xml-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely  on xml for mission critical applications."  about venrock associates venrock associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the  rockefeller family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs  that now spans over seven decades. laurance s. rockefeller pioneered  early stage venture financing in the 1930s. with over 300 investments  over a span of more than 70 years, the firm has an established a track  record of identifying and supporting promising early stage, technology-  based enterprises. as one of most experienced venture firms in the  united states, venrock maintains a tradition of collaboration with  talented entrepreneurs to establish successful, enduring companies.  venrock's continuing goal is to create long-term value by assisting  entrepreneurs in building companies from the formative stages. their  consistent focus on information technology and life sciences-related  opportunities provides a reservoir of knowledge and a network of  contacts that have proven to be a catalyst for the growth of developing  organizations. venrock's investments have included checkpoint software,  usinternetworking, caliper technologies, illumina, niku, doubleclick,  media metrix, 3com, intel, and apple computer. with offices in new york  city, cambridge, ma, and menlo park, ca, venrock is well positioned to  respond to opportunities in any locale. for more information on venrock  associates, please visit www.venrock.com  about mobius venture capital mobius venture capital, formerly softbank venture capital, is a $2.5  billion u.s.-based private equity venture capital firm managed by an  unparalleled team of former ceos and entrepreneurs, technology pioneers,  senior executives from major technology corporations, and leaders from  the investment banking community. mobius venture capital specializes  primarily in early-stage investments in the areas of: communications  systems software and services;

"enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and   intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill   prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.   datapower s xml-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed   processing of   xml that is required to support next generation enterprise   applications," said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower   technology.    "datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s   critical to web   services projects without sacrificing an ounce of   performance." a single   datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10   servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml   processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in   addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,   protection against xml-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of   e-business protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load   balancing   between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.    "in the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require   laser-focused scrutiny. datapower s patent-pending technology   addresses   a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said michael   tyrrell of venrock associates. "by turbo-charging their networks with   datapower s unique xml-aware networking technology, companies will be   free to adopt next generation web services without encountering   performance and security pitfalls."    "we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing   the rapidly   growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and   security," said bill burnham of mobius venture capital.   "datapower is on   their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml   generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most   compelling technology solution we have seen to date."    "xml is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious   about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999,   datapower has been   developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web   services," said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. "datapower s   xml-acceleration devices are a key requirement for   enterprises that rely   on xml for mission critical applications."    about venrock associates  venrock associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the   rockefeller family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs   that now spans over seven decades. laurance s. rockefeller pioneered   early stage venture financing in the 1930s. with over 300 investments   over a span of more than 70 years, the firm has an   established a track   record of identifying and supporting promising early stage,   technology-   based enterprises. as one of most experienced venture firms in the   united states, venrock maintains a tradition of collaboration with   talented entrepreneurs to establish successful, enduring companies.   venrock's continuing goal is to create long-term value by assisting   entrepreneurs in building companies from the formative stages. their   consistent focus on information technology and life sciences-related   opportunities provides a reservoir of knowledge and a network of   contacts that have proven to be a catalyst for the growth of   developing   organizations. venrock's investments have included checkpoint   software,   usinternetworking, caliper technologies, illumina, niku, doubleclick,   media metrix, 3com, intel, and apple computer. with offices   in new york   city, cambridge, ma, and menlo park, ca, venrock is well   positioned to   respond to opportunities in any locale. for more information   on venrock   associates, please visit www.venrock.com    about mobius venture capital  mobius venture capital, formerly softbank venture capital, is a $2.5   billion u.s.-based private equity venture capital firm managed by an   unparalleled team of former ceos and entrepreneurs,   technology pioneers,   senior executives from major technology corporations, and   leaders from   the investment banking community. mobius venture capital specializes   primarily in early-stage investments in the areas of: communications   systems software and services;

"our vision is to build out an xml-aware infrastructure," kelly said.  "the xa35 is the first of a family."  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up  to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers; datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative.  in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml.  "today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only," kelly  said. "a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today."  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.  according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.  "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing -- claims that he believes  will be mostly false. other content-aware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)  accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.  the 1u-high network device has been tested against a large collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device.  the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.  in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application  co-processor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device.  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup  sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in  may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spin-off, launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises.  ======================================================================== =  datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml  grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class m.i.t. engineers and  designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software  interpreter called dgxt. this software-based approach to xml processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing software-based accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purpose-built hardware. in  2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3 ), the  industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.  today, xg3  technology powers the industry's first wire-speed xml  network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and xml web  services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industry-leading customers and partners.  datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.  ======================================================================== =  datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding  venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer  in xml-aware networking for web services  cambridge, mass. - july 8, 2002 - datapower technology, inc., the  leading provider of xml-aware network infrastructure, today announced  that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for  this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed  capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius,  and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapower s board of  directors.  datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and  sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml-aware networking.  founded in 1999, datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml  networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions  at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services  and other xml-centric initiatives. datapower s solutions are based on  its patent-pending xml generation three (xg3 ) technology.

easy_ham,on tue, 27 aug 2002, rohit khare wrote:   datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data. unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software, datapower's device processes the data in  hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance,  according to company officials.  now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used on all transaction in order to process them... so this has some preaty heavy implications, unless it's just bs.   kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up  to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers; datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative.  or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. nah! (that was the whole point of xml afterall, to sell more cpus - much like oracle's use of java allows them to sell 3x more cpu licenses due to the performance hit)   in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml.   "today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only," kelly  said. "a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today."  again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...   "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  mmmmmmmmmmm, machine code, never a good idea ;)  - adam l.

easy_ham,hello folks! i'm new to linux, so here goes... i've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem. i've got debian with kernel 2.4.18. i've got this win-modem(yes, i know) and managed to locate a proper driver for it. minicom is very much able to dial out. but there seems to be a problem with my pppd installation. when i type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all i get (after the initial info of my dynamic ip, etc) is a ~ and then the no carrier signal. then i looked into calling pppd directly using chat. i used this command:  pppd call provider (where provider is some script somewhere). it dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection is established, it gives the sighup signal and exits. this is confirmed when me friend and i tried to connect through a serial port using pppd to connect ttys0.  i ran pppd waiting for a connection, me friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.  some expert help would be greatly appreciated as i'm sick and tired of having to reboot, get into windoze to hook up to the net and then back to linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  it'd be nice never have to go back to windoze(except for games, that is).  thanks a million. carlos    --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

easy_ham, i'm not familiar with dell dimension xps, and, to be honest, not familiar with any brand-name computers. most of my experience is china motherboards, but i've seen same behavior once. changing the battery helps that time. it was big round battery with 'panasonic' on it. computer starts beeping then we removed battery from mb. it even booted up (well, loosing time and some other things).  just my 2 cents.  misha  on wed, 28 aug 2002, aherne peter-pahern02 wrote:   ok, iknow this is blatantly ot but i'm beginning to go insane.  had an old dell dimension xps sitting in the corner and decided to  put it to use,     --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

easy_ham,hi all,  i've decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers. as usual the result is that i've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-)  i've got the whole thing working on a valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on enigma, limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-)  here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - install this "alsa-driver" package - install the "alsa-libs" package - install the "alsa-utils" package  now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default oss driver loading : http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ (very complete and very good documentation!) hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)  reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and insert the new ones. if all is well you've got alsa working! ("dmesg" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.  with "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. you can also install the xmms plugin (seems to make my xmms segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it!  it really isn't complicated, and has never been from what i see. the only thing i disliked was to have to install from source... but as i can't imagine myself doing that ;-) i've repackaged everything cleanly. even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, i insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. there are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided alsa spec files, for example i've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!).  i'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!  download : http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/  current spec files : http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec (all others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )  matthias  ps: as an extra bonus, i've also recompiled xine with alsa support! simply run "xine -a alsa09" and off you go! it may even support 5.1 and s/pdif ;-)  --  clean custom red hat linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/ red hat linux release 7.3 (valhalla) running linux kernel 2.4.18-10 load : 0.57 0.42 0.42, ac on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)  _______________________________________________ rpm-list mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

easy_ham,http://www.cnn.com/2002/world/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html  lima, peru (reuters) -- lina medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in peru's andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital.   just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy.   aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by caesarean section in may 1939, medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world.   at the time, peru's government promised aid that never materialized. six decades on, medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the peruvian capital known as "little chicago."   now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40.   but a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to medina's story, and raised the prospect that the peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance.   "the government condemned them to live in poverty. in any other country, they would be the objects of special care," jose sandoval, author of "mother aged 5," told reuters.   "we still have time to repair the damage done to her. that's my fundamental objective," he added.   'totally willing to help' sandoval has raised medina's case with the office of first lady eliane karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible.   "we're totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman marta castaneda. but suni ramos, of the social action department of karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. it is currently trying to contact medina and her family.   medina's husband, raul jurado, told reuters his wife remained skeptical. "she got no help (in 1939) that i know about," he said. "she thinks governments never deliver. maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."   jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, had turned down reuters' request for an interview.   medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped.   one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo, an andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in peru's poorest province, medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, sandoval said.   he said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs.   her swelling stomach worried her parents. "they thought it was a tumor," he said. but shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, pisco.   there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant.   her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case.   sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a u.s. businessman, which was turned down.   more offers followed after medina was transferred to a lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on may 14, 1939 -- mother's day.   one offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for medina and her baby to be exhibited at the world's fair in new york. another, from a u.s. business that the family accepted in early june 1939, was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case. the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort.   but within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them.   but sandoval said: "it abandoned the case after six months ...it did absolutely nothing for them."   happy ending? though physically mature, medina -- who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse.   medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again.   after taunting from schoolmates, gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother.   he died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young.   medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. her second child now lives in mexico.   she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "we just want to get on with our lives, that's it," said jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother.   he said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site.   he said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise.   "if the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property," he said.   as for sandoval, he said he was optimistic that medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "i believe there will be a happy ending," he said.   "as a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed." abraham lincoln (nov 21, 1864 in a letter to col. william f elkins)      [non-text portions of this message have been removed]   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool  for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole  'anonymity' thing. also i notice this story shows the truth - the  canadian government is really located in washington, dc, ottawa is just  a branch office. come to think of it, the last story i posted about  canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military  hq  in palm beach, florida.' owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *will canada's isps become spies?* by declan mccullagh  staff writer, cnet news.com august 27, 2002, 12:56 pm pt http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html    *washington--the canadian government is considering a proposal that  would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy  surveillance by police and spy agencies.*  a discussion draft   released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every  canadian with an internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the  right to be anonymous online.  the canadian government, including the department of justice   and industry canada  , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step  in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to  conduct electronic surveillance. a proposed law based on the discussion  draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in  early 2003.  arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,  canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and  combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. they also claim that by enacting  these proposals, canada will be following its obligations under the  council of europe's cybercrime treaty  , which the country is in the  process of considering.  if the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the  possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order internet  providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months, and  permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden  electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. in  most circumstances, a court order would be required for government  agents to conduct internet monitoring.  canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of  europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have  endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty  , which has  drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.  of nearly 50 participating nations, only albania has formally adopted  ,  or ratified, the treaty.  michael geist , a professor at the  university of ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the  justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems  weak.  "it seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the  changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to  make changes," geist said. "to me that's not a particularly convincing  argument. if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,  make that case."  geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new  powers) are needed. i don't know that there have been a significant  number of cases where police have run into problems."  probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is  compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure  their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention  orders. the united states has a similar requirement, called the  communications assistance for law enforcement act  , but it  applies only to pre-internet telecommunications companies.  "it is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and  internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical  capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national  security agencies," according to the proposal. companies would be  responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.  sarah andrews, an analyst at the electronic privacy information center   (epic) who specializes in international law, says  the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "their  proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not  just internet providers," andrews said. "the cybercrime treaty deals  only with computer data." epic opposes    the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and  does not adequately respect privacy rights.  another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs  of police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with  personal information about all canadian internet users. "the  implementation of such a database would presuppose that service  providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"  the draft says.  gus hosein, a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an  activist with privacy international, calls the database "a dumb idea."  "immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous  mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the internet  anonymously," hosein said.  a representative for george radwanski  , canada's privacy commissioner, said  the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on  the paper as it stands."  comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca   no later than nov. 15.

easy_ham,http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481687  2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort  holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach. the savannah monitor lizard was captured at chapel st leonards, lincs, on sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an rspca team. rspca officer justin stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer, said: "savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long." officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner because it has not been reported missing. savannah monitor lizards originate in africa and are carnivorous, eating rats and small rodents. they can grow to 4ft in length. anyone with information about the lizard can contact the rspca in confidence on 08705 555 999.  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481620  close encounter of burnt kind  it came from outer space   or did it? teenager siobhan cowton is convinced the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home in northallerton is extra-terrestrial. but while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite. siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation   that the odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,. but on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed   because it was hot when she picked it up. it hit her on a foot but caused no injury. "i looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble surface," she said. after closer inspection by her father niel, and comparison with pictures on the internet, siobhan plans to ask scientists at durham university to check the object for authenticity. if it is from outer space, siobhan says she will consider putting it up for auction. she added: "if it isn't worth anything then i suppose i will keep it myself for sentimental value. it is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite." but dr ben horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of academic caution. "meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece of extraterrestrial rock," he said. "they have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions and cavities. if they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt around the edge. "most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the smallest that they usually appear." to establish the provenance of siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have to be subject to a mineral breakdown but dr horton thinks the chances of it being extra-terrestrial are slim. "around 50,000 a year strike the earth's surface and, considering the size of the earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite. "however, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen," he added.   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm   big cats are on the loose in britain and breeding their way towards record numbers, a monitoring group has claimed.  the british big cats society said it has received more than 800 reports of animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called fen tigers over the past 12 months.   and while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.   society founder daniel bamping told bbc news online he could cope with the critics and doubters, adding: "i was a sceptic, i thought it was in the same realm as the loch ness monster.   "but it's not, they are really out there."   'cats with cubs'   mr bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country.   big cat reports   hotspots include scotland and gloucestershire  january 2002 - kent man clawed by suspected lynx  november 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat  april 2001 - lynx captured in north london  1999 - puma-like cat attacks horse in wales   "this weekend alone i have had sightings from wales, the scottish borders, kent, the west midlands, devon, somerset and wiltshire," he said.   the society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals.   but mr bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves.   "we have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added.   'trigger camera'   the society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples.   but it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story.   a national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes, will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats.   mr bamping said: "the idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself."   'like dogs'   the society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild, or their descendants.   its spokesman danny nineham said: "in the 1960s and 1970s, people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs.   "but in 1976 when the dangerous wild animals act came into force, people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them down, or take them to a zoo."  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm  us soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable translation device will be an essential part of their equipment.  scientists at carnegie mellon university have developed a prototype of a speech translator that was road-tested by us army chaplains in croatia.   "this project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools," said the team from carnegie mellon university in a research paper published recently.   the research was commissioned by the us army, which is increasingly finding itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key.   speaking in tongues   "in the balkans, the army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," robert frederking of carnegie mellon university told the bbc programme go digital.     translators could be essential for us soldiers   "in a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up and you are holding them apart.   "you can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and talk to them," he said.   the portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially available laptops.   the army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation. so instead the translator was tested by us army chaplains in croatia.   "the chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and typically don't have any translation support," explained mr frederking.   slow system   for the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to croatians who knew just a smattering of english.   the system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in croatian, turns the speech into text. the written words are then translated into english and read out by a speech synthesizer.   "it went reasonably well half the time," said mr frederking, though it was slow in translating phrases.   the research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the field.   but they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to work with further research and development.   the audio voice translation guide system project was a joint venture between the us army, the military manufacturer lockheed martin and carnegie mellon university.    ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- receive phone calls and faxes while you're online! emerson switchboard eliminates the need for a second phone line. order the switchboard today for $39.95 + shipping and handling. http://us.click.yahoo.com/p2spya/o6keaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,ananova:   brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'  scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by keeping herds of insects. the amazonian schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and building materials. the bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a species called cryptostigma. cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey. the insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees scrape off and use for their nest. nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in bees. biologist joao camargo, of the university of sao paulo in brazil, said: "in turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection." writing in the journal biotropica, camargo says the bees might even carry their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further research on how they tend to their herd. studies of the schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar from the insect farms. some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt. story filed: 13:49 wednesday 28th august 2002  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- super blue stuff pain relief - on sale today for $29.95 + shipping! with super blue stuff you ll feel the results in just minutes. relieves arthritis pain, back pain, sore muscles, and more! http://us.click.yahoo.com/n2spya/q6keaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/     
easy_ham,not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm   betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to vhs.  betamax's manufacturer, sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000 more machines for the japanese market.   they have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.     vhs became the dominant format by the mid-1980s   betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better quality than its vhs rival.   some 2.3 million betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year, 1984, but it soon went downhill as vhs became the format of choice for the film rental industry and in homes.   just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to march 2002.   "with digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to secure parts," sony said in a statement.   sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the format.   the professional betamax format, betacam, is still widely used in the television and film industries and will be unaffected.   but the recent rise of dvds seems to have put the final nail in the coffin for betamax home players.   in the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the vhs format.   betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of competition from vhs that they set up the betaphile club in 1988.   the picture and sound quality of beta was superior to vhs, betaphiles say, although vhs tapes had a longer duration.   a total of 18 million betamax machines were sold around the world, but no new ones will be made after the end of 2002.   sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.    see also:       ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- kwick pick portable lock pick - opens almost any lock! locked out? try the kwick pick. for $17.95, you can open car doors, desk drawers, padlocks, and much more! never get locked out again! http://us.click.yahoo.com/o2spya/p6keaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,the latest - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2240487.stm  friday, 6 september, 2002, 08:53 gmt 09:53 uk zimbabwe eases gm stance  zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (gm) grain so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the un food agency. the executive director of the world food programme, james morris, said zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in the region which have refused food aid because it might contain gm grain. until now, zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute ground maize to allay fears that gm grain could be planted. but a zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system. there have been fears that southern african nations could lose lucrative export markets in europe if they cannot certify that their crops are gm-free. aid mr morris announced the policy reversal after talks in harare with zimbabwean president robert mugabe. "the fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in accepting gm crops or commodities will be an important signal to other countries in the region," mr morris told journalists. "it will enable us to do our job," he said. aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in southern africa face famine. in zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid. the wfp says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes of food it intends to bring into zimbabwe in the next few months. the government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has worsened the situation, say many donors. lost markets the gm row has complicated relief efforts across the region. zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on gm food aid, labelling it as 'poison' . deals to mill gm food before being distributed, so that it could not be planted, have placated fears in malawi and mozambique. united states aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that americans eat gm maize every day. the world health organisation has certified the grain for human consumption and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.  ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- looking for a more powerful website? try geocities for $8.95 per month. register your domain name (http://your-name.com). more storage! no ads! http://geocities.yahoo.com/ps/info http://us.click.yahoo.com/ahoo4d/kjoeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,the times   september 06, 2002    scissors are a snip for third world  from richard owen in rome        it is one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the  millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from  passengers  hand luggage? most are thrown away or recycled after being seized  as part of security measures since september 11. but an enterprising chaplain  is sending them to catholic missionaries for distribution to third world  hospitals and clinics. in theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail  files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for  them to be returned. in practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the  x-ray scanners.     father arturo rossini, chaplain of malpensa airport in milan, said that  scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of africa, asia and latin  america.     he told corriere della sera that he had  plucked up the courage  to ask the  authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. with the help of a  retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure  sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre.     packages were shipped in aircraft holds to peru, brasil, india, mozambique,  argentina, zambia and kenya.  in such countries, what we think of as a  personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.      the idea has been taken up at other italian airports.        ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- plan to sell a home? http://us.click.yahoo.com/j2snna/y.leaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,the times      september 06, 2002    hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties  by roger boyes        managers of germany s political parties are having difficulty explaining their  enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed  largely from mein kampf, hitler s personal manifesto. the incident illustrates  how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an  election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to  those of the f hrer.      edmund stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading germany than the  present chancellor,  said one letter sent to the christian social union  headquarters in ingolstadt.  chancellor schr der is doing nothing to stop the  flood of foreigners who are spreading around our fatherland,  said the letter,  signed by a certain rudolph lewald.     the csu immediately spotted a potential member.  many thanks for your nice  thoughts,  replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for  membership.     the letter used chunks of hitler s book, which is still banned in germany.  history students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.       the strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of  existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,   the letter-writer said.  so-called humanity is melting like snow in the march  sun.  such phrases were lifted from mein kampf, which was written while hitler  was in jail after the failed munich putsch of 1923.     similar letters, also using the nazi leader s words, were sent to the other  political parties and drew sympathetic responses.  i read your letter with  great interest and pleasure,  the manager of the christian democratic union in  cologne, said.      great that you want to join us!  enthused the green party headquarters. the  free democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball  at which hans- dietrich genscher, the former foreign minister, would be the  star guest. the social democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by  gerhard schr der, the chancellor.      i wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing  extremism,  said the letter-writer, who was in fact the cologne novelist  rainer popp.  i had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic.      for the first few days i expected two men in leather coats from the special  branch to knock on my door. instead only the postman called   with packets of  election material from zealous political headquarters,  herr popp said.      i was stunned that political parties could react in this way   i reckon i  would have had the same response if i had signed the letter  adolf hitler .          ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- 4 dvds free +s&p join now http://us.click.yahoo.com/pt6ybb/nxieaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham,hi all,  i have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction.  i am involved in porting a sco unix application to linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores  are being handled. the application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled via semaphores.  in certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, i have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop() system call.  i have also noticed that if i introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away, but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww !! lol  is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state  in a semaphore immediately?  setting sem_flg = ipc_nowait and checking for errno == eagain and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails (-1) also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet.  both the parent controlling process run as the same uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions 0666.  any pointers would be appreciated!  rgds,  colin nevin   __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? everything you'll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music charts http://uk.my.yahoo.com  --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

easy_ham,http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?cid=1051-100802b    the disappearing alliance by dale franks 10/08/2002   for over two generations, the countries of western europe have been our closest allies. we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization. we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism.  tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.  europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed "progressive transnationalism". the key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations.  the european union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations, is post-democratic. while there is a european parliament, the eu's power resides mainly in the unelected european commission (ec) and its unelected president, who face few limits to their power. instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the eu has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. moreover, the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu's political elite. both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments. this is a step backward in europe's political development.  european criticism of america is on the rise, and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one. they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. they hate the fact that our citizens own guns. they despise the fact that we execute murderers. they resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that americans consume so much. they also resent?and fear - the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world.  on august 9, 2002, adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk's independent newspaper, in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained, perhaps by a european military invasion, followed by a decade or so of occupation. fortunately, the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us, but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic.  at least, for now.  despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite.  the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states. because they have built such a system in europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. america, however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it does on compliance with international "norms." they view all departures from such norms as aberrant. because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. the trouble with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic, authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic societies. it sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.  thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. our repeated references to the us constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. they assume, therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights.  none of this bodes well for the future of euro-american friendship, or cooperation. if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the us will rise, while their tolerance of our differences will fall. obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase.  that thought is frightening enough. even more frightening, however, is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism.   --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'

easy_ham,i can't believe i actually read a laugh-out-loud funny profile of the  *fcc commissioner* fer crissakes! so the following article comes  recommended, a fine explanation of michael powell's extraordinary  equivocation.  on the other hand, i can also agree with werbach's werblog entry... rohit   a trip to f.c.c. world   nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc   chairman michael powell.  it's one of the first articles i've seen that   captures some of powell's real personality, and the way he's viewed in   washington.  unfortunately, lemann ends by endorsing conventional   political wisdom.  after describing how powell isn't really a   fire-breathing ideological conservative, he concludes that, in essence,   powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies, while a   democratic fcc would favor new entrants.  i know that's not how powell   sees the world, and though i disagree with him on many issues, i think   he's right to resist the old dichotomy.   the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who   went through it.  the disaster wasn't the regulators' fault, as some   conservatives argue.  but something clearly went horribly wrong, and   policy-makers should learn from that experience.  contrary to lemann's   speculation, the upstart carriers won't be successful in a gore   administration, because it's too late.  virtually all of them are dead,   and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable   future.  some may survive, but as small players rather than   world-dominators.    the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is   old news.  the next important battle in telecom will be between those   who want to stay within the traditional boxes, and those who use   different models entirely.  that's why open broadband networks and open   spectrum are so important.  whatever the regulatory environment, there   is going to be consolidation in telecom.  those left out in that   consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into   the home, or slowly die. the victors in the consolidation game will cut   back on innovation and raise prices, which will create further pressure   for alternatives.    lemann is right that policy-making looks much drier and more ambiguous   on the ground than through the lens of history.  but he's wrong in   thinking that telecom's future will be something like its past.   friday, october 04, 2002  11:17:11 am  comments {0}   ============================================================== http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact/021007fa_fact  the chairman  by nicholas lemann he's the other powell, and no one is sure what he's up to. new yorker, october 8, 2002  last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first  fairly serious american-history course, indignantly reported that the  whole subject was incomprehensible. i was shocked. what about gettysburg  and the declaration of independence and the selma-to-montgomery march?  just look at my textbook, he said, and when i did i saw his point. his  class had got up to the eighteen-forties. what i expected was a big  beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks, and, in-deed,  there was some of that. but the main difference between my son's text  and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous  decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american  history. there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and  reciprocal trade agreements. i skipped ahead, past the civil war, hoping  for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation  of freight rates. only a few decades into the twentieth century did it  become possible to see the federal government's main function as  responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice,  instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic  interests.  even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty  speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington, what you'd find  is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so  much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real  estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. the arena in which  this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and  commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. it's  an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because  the public and the press encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon  can't get themselves interested.  one corner of washington might be called f.c.c. world, for the federal  communications commission. f.c.c. world has perhaps five thousand  denizens. they work at the commission itself, at the house and senate  commerce committees, and at the washington offices of the companies that  the commission regulates. they read communications daily (subscription  price: $3,695 a year), and every year around christmastime they  grumblingly attend the chairman's dinner, at a washington hotel, where  the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating  comedy routine by the commission's chairman.  of all the federal agencies and commissions, the f.c.c. is the one that  americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with  a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the  american economy, as well as important aspects of daily life telephone  and television and radio and newspapers and the internet. and right now  f.c.c. world is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather,  because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the  "corporate scandals" concerns the economic collapse of companies  regulated by the f.c.c. qwest, worldcom, adelphia, and global crossing,  among others, are (or were) part of f.c.c. world. aol time warner is  part of f.c.c. world. jack grubman, the former salomon smith barney  analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay, of enron, as the  embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of f.c.c. world. in the  past two years, companies belonging to f.c.c. world have lost trillions  of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a  dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.  this year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state  of the f.c.c. has been circulating widely within f.c.c. world. it evokes  f.c.c. world's feverish mood ("the f.c.c. is fiddling while rome burns")  and suggests why nobody besides residents of f.c.c. world has thought of  the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. the sentence i  just quoted is followed by this explanation: "the ilecs appear likely to  enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no  residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10%  market share loss in business lines to clecs." it's a lot easier to  think about evil c.e.o.s than to decipher that.   even in good times, f.c.c. world pays obsessive attention to the  commission's chairman. in bad times, the attention becomes especially  intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity f.c.c. world devotes  itself to full-time chairman-watching. the current chairman, michael  powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards,  because he is the only son of colin powell, the secretary of state.  unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which  generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about  who he really is and what he's really up to. powell is young to be the  head of a federal agency he is thirty-nine and genially charming.  everybody likes him. before becoming chairman, he was for three years  one of the f.c.c.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the  f.c.c.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a clintonesque love of the  arcane details of communications policy. he's always saying that he's an  "avid moderate." and yet he has a rage-inciting quality. one of his  predecessors as chairman, reed hundt, quoted in forbes, compared powell  to herbert hoover. mark cooper, of the consumer federation of america,  calls him "radical and extreme." just as often as he's accused of being  a right-wing ideologue, powell gets accused of being paralytically  cautious. "it ain't about singing 'kum-ba-yah' around the campfire,"  another former chairman, william kennard, says. "you have to have an  answer." one day last spring, powell, testifying before a senate  subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the  subcommittee's chairman, ernest hollings, of south carolina, berated  him. "you don't care about these regulations," hollings said. "you don't  care about the law or what congress sets down. . . . that's the  fundamental. that's the misgiving i have of your administration over  there. it just is amazing to me. you just pell-mell down the road and  seem to not care at all. i think you'd be a wonderful executive  vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a  regulatory commission at the government level. are you happy in your  job?"  "extremely," powell said, with an amiable smile.   one cannot understand powell's maddening effect, at least on democrats  and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose  of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. the f.c.c. was  created by congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the  new deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy  cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure  that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. its  other original function was preventing american telephone & telegraph,  the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers  unfairly. over the decades, as f.c.c. world grew up into a comfortable,  well-established place, the f.c.c. segued into the role of industrial  supervision its real purpose. it was supposed to manage the competition  among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by  artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business.  in addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission  more specifically protected the interests of members of congress, many  of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most  terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank  president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster.  according to an oft-told f.c.c. world anecdote, president clinton once  blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers  in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the  anti-clinton little rock democrat-gazette had owned the leading tv  station in little rock, too, clinton would never have become president.   f.c.c. world may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too,  because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic  niches for themselves. then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful  breakup of a.t. & t. by far the biggest and most important company the  commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of  self-confidence onto the consciousness of f.c.c. world. a generation  ago, for most americans, there was one local phone company, one  long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones,  which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same  company. it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. by the  mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local  phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing  to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores  everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and  millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the  telephone lines. a.t. & t. had argued for years that it was a "natural  monopoly," requiring protection from economic competition and total  control over its lines. so much for that argument. over the same period,  the f.c.c. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones  and the internet. it was the dream of federal-agency success come true:  consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more  prosperous, too.  the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of 1996,  one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which  most people outside f.c.c. world probably felt it was safe to ignore.  although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of  modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group  bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers  as "baby bells" and to f.c.c. world as "arbocks" (the pronounced version  of rbocs, or regional bell operating companies), would be permitted to  offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance  companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for  customers. consumers would win, because for the first time they would  get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more  competition than they already had in long distance. but the politics and  economics of the telecom act (which was shepherded through congress by  vice-president gore) were just as important. democrats saw the act as  helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that  brought the internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of  jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose  beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. clinton's  slogans about the "information superhighway" and "building a bridge to  the twenty-first century," which, like all clinton slogans, artfully  sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical  correlates of the telecom act, and gore's cruise to the presidency was  supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.  the f.c.c. had a crucial role in all this. the arbocks are rich,  aggressive, politically powerful, and generally republican (though like  all important interest groups they work with both parties); they  immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new  competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. through  rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the f.c.c., then headed by  reed hundt, who was gore's classmate at st. albans, was supposed to keep  the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies  like a.t. & t. and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new  companies, "see-lecks" (the pronounced version of clecs, or competitive  local exchange carriers), could emerge. this entailed the regulatory  equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have  access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the  seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the  f.c.c. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.  partly because hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that  he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming  condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the  see-lecks companies with names like winstar, covad, and teligent and  into other telecommunications companies. even not obviously related  technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom  boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks  and other new players. there would be no conflict between the interests  of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of hundt's  former lieutenants told me, "reed used to joke that my job was to make  sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."   the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the  boom. wall street had its blood up, and that meant not just more  startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies:  time warner and aol decided to throw in together, and a.t. & t. and  comcast, and so on. (surely, worldcom and the other telecom bad guys  believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative  accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so  undiscriminating.)  by the time the outcome of the 2000 presidential election had been  determined, the telecom crash was well under way. nonetheless, the  chairmanship of the f.c.c. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of  influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator.  three republicans emerged as candidates: powell, who was a commissioner;  harold furchtgott-roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and  patrick wood, the head of the texas public utility commission and, as  such, a george w. bush guy. in texas, however, wood had crossed the most  powerful person in the arbock camp, edward whitacre, the c.e.o. of  s.b.c. communications, which is headquartered in san antonio. this meant  that the arbocks didn't want wood as head of the f.c.c., because he  might be too pro-see-leck. (wood is now the head of the federal energy  regulatory commission.) michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he  wasn't as threatening as wood, while also signalling the conservative  movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than  furchtgott-roth.  powell did this deftly. for example, in december of 2000 he appeared  before a conservative group called the progress & freedom foundation and  gave a very michael powell speech whimsical, intellectual, and  free-associative (biblical history, joseph schumpeter, moore's law) that  began by making fun of the idea that the f.c.c. should try to keep new  telecom companies alive. "in the wake of the 1996 act, the f.c.c. is  often cast as the grinch who stole christmas," powell said. "like the  whos, down in who-ville, who feast on who-pudding and rare who-roast  beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the  deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act's  fertile soil. but this feast the f.c.c. grinch did not like in the  least, so it is thought." thus powell was indicating that if he became  chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as  part of the job. he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day  of the bush administration.  twenty months into the administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead  or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just worldcom, are in  serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite  companies are staggering. the crash has had an automatically  concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing  companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in  good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged  companies at bargain prices. during the bush administration, as the  financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications  industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. if the bells  wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and  if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national  duopoly in local service: verizon, in the east, and s.b.c., in the west.  and these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the  poor health of the long-distance companies.  the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national  companies, aol time warner and comcast. unlike the phone companies, they  don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more  fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. as part  of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996  telecom act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were  significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of  radio-station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty-five  per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news  programming is supplied by a single company, westwood one, a subsidiary  of viacom.  in this situation, many democrats and liberals think, the f.c.c. should  be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation, springing to the  rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. it should try  to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. it should  disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the  forces of concentration. it should use the government's money and muscle  to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the  homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (an  analogy that a lot of people in f.c.c. world make is between telecom and  the middle east: the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush  people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the bush  people blame it on the clinton people, because they raised too many  expectations and stirred too many passions.)  but michael powell's f.c.c. has not been hyperactive. powell has been  conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the  f.c.c. and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him  signals. (in mid-september, powell finally initiated a formal review of  the f.c.c.'s limits on media concentration.) this doesn't mean he has  been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further  infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and  the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of  f.c.c. world really make sense, while giving the impression that he's  having the time of his life as chairman. at his first press conference,  when he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital  divide" that is, economic inequality in access to the internet he said,  "you know, i think there is a mercedes divide. i'd like to have one and  i can't afford one." at the national cable & telecommunications  association convention, in chicago, powell, following a troupe of  tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a  somersault.   not long ago, i went to see powell in his office at the f.c.c. until  1998, when the commission moved to a new building in southwest  washington, near the city's open-air fish market, f.c.c. world was at  the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody  else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. today, the f.c.c. building  looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park.  even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and  fluorescent. powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and  walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a  jeep accident in germany, in 1987, when he was an army officer. because  of the accident, he left the army and went to law school, where he  became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly  the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of  the market before the fact "prophylactically," as he likes to say should  wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust  litigation to fix them. he worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and  then became a prot g  of joel klein, the head of the antitrust division  of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government's  legal case against microsoft. (he was recently appointed chancellor of  the new york public-school system.) it testifies to powell's political  skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush  administration who not only served in the clinton administration but  also maintains close ties to bush's nemesis senator john mccain, of  arizona. one of the things about powell that annoy people is his  enduring love of law school "it's sort of like a law-school study  session over there," one democratic former commissioner said. as if to  confirm the charge, powell, when i arrived, introduced me to four law  students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.  i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions  of the f.c.c. for example, could private companies have apportioned the  airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?  "i think we'll never know," powell said. "i don't think it's an  automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. land is probably  the best analogue. we don't seize all the land in the united states and  say, 'the government will issue licenses to use land.' if my neighbor  puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law  about what i can do about that, including whether i can tear it down. if  a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a  similar proposition. there are scholars who argue indeed, the famous  ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that  spectrum policy is lunacy. the market could work this out, in the kinds  of ways that we're accustomed to."  talking to powell was fun. unlike most high government officials, he  doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. he  slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. he speaks in  ironic air quotes. he's like your libertarian friend in college who  enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions  about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he  sees as sentimental or illogical. after a while, i asked him whether he  thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 telecommunications  act had been excessive.  "i would start with a caveat," powell said. "look, i can't fault those  judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought.  they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities.  but, frankly, i've always been a little bit critical. first of all,  anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close  to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the president  on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. i mean, i  don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions,  or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that  were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. when one starts  reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions.  but, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an internet  excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it  certainly was.  "but. we were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of  expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the  economy or the market even gets in trouble. it was a dramatically  exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission, by  politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. it was a  gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones  that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. everybody wanted to  see numbers go up on the board."  powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act. "  'i want to see ten competitors. twenty competitors! i want to see  thirty-per-cent market share. fifty-per-cent market share! i want the  bells to bleed! then we'll know we've succeeded.' " now powell returned  to being powell. "i think that expectation was astonishingly  unrealistic, in the short term. they wanted to see it while they're  there. we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. and  the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. there's no  question, we went too soon too fast. too many companies took on too much  debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business  model."  how could the telecom act have been handled better? "we could have  chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were  slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"  powell said. "money chased what seemed like government-promised  opportunity. the problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're  in it. and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. this  debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. in some  ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."  powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there  had been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "no, we wouldn't have  every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don't anyway. i  don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. i don't buy  that. the bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? the  part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so  would mci worldcom and sprint."  other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable  businesses, either, and they never might. "everybody's always saying,  'the regulators did this and this and this.' but, candidly, the story's  quite the opposite. i think the regulators bent over backward for six  years to give them a chance. conditions don't get that good except once  every thirty years, and it didn't happen. so, whatever the reason, we're  looking at a worldcom that's teetering. we're looking at a long-distance  business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. a.t. & t. is  breaking itself up. sprint has struggled."  could the f.c.c. have done anything to make the long-distance companies  stronger? "at the f.c.c.? i think i'll just be blunt. my political  answer? yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try  to help. but i can't find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere.  i can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s.e.c.  investigation. were i king, it would be wonderful, but i don't have  those kinds of levers. i don't know whether anybody does. at some point,  companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from  dying." powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think  it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. he has  demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist  gestures in august, for example, five months after disbanding the  f.c.c.'s accounting safeguards division, powell announced that he was  appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the  communications industry. but that shows that powell is better at riding  out the storm than, say, harvey pitt, his counterpart at the securities  and exchange commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore  up the telecom industry.  i asked powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one  company provided cable television and only one provided local phone  service. "yes," he said. "it concerns us that there's one of each of  those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one  of each of those things. that still is a nice suite of communications  capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."  anyway, powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to  provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will  provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice.  "so, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. the question  is, does it stay that way?"  the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of  information did not appear to trouble powell, either. he said that  people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration,  which distorts markets. "if this were just economics, it's easy. if you  were to say to me, 'mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we  know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust. i can tell you when a  market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. the problem is  other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. take  the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption  there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic  viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. i  think that's a possibility. i don't think it's nearly the possibility  that's ascribed to it sometimes."  powell explained, "sometimes when we see very pointed political or  parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. i see some of the  same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh  exists. they love diversity, but somehow we should run howard stern off  the planet. if it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias,  and then we have policies like" here his tone went from ironic to  sarcastic "the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis  of what i thought those people cared about. so when somebody is pointed  and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic  fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."   f.c.c. world abounds in theories about michael powell. one is that he  can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries  he regulates so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the  market, in order to buy himself time. another is that he's carrying  water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. another is that he is  planning to run for the senate from virginia (or to be appointed  attorney general in a second bush term), and doesn't want to do anything  at the f.c.c. that would diminish his chances. another is that he's  waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action,  so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the  crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television  networks. (in f.c.c. world, this is known as the powell doctrine of  telecom, after colin powell's idea that the united states should never  commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force,  and an exit strategy.) and another is that he actually believes what he  says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and  irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.  "this is why elections matter," reed hundt, who isn't happy about what  has become of his telecom act, told me. it's true that the f.c.c. much  more than, say, the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore  administration would be acting quite differently from the bush  administration. consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but  there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. the  arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would  have done if gore had won. next election, they'll help the party that  helped them. if the republicans win, policy will tilt further in the  arbocks' favor. if they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivals the  long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their  friends now in power, will stage a comeback. america's present is not  unrecognizably different from america's past.

easy_ham,  i have translated the article in full - see  end of post (i think that i've done a far  better job than the google translation - at  least it's readable now - any corrections appreciated).  stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions  to the debate.  my apologies if i've paraphrased anybody  incorrectly, i will be glad to retract if  anyone is miffed.    the article makes four main points.   1) absence of critical clauses.    in this case, the idea is that the licence  is invalid because it doesn't specify under what country's law the gpl is governed.   2) specification in english only.  that for the end user (as opposed to businesses),  the gpl doesn't apply because it's not written  in french.   3) arbitary licence change.  the point here is that (under french law) the  author can change the terms of the licence  arbitarily. this is because any granting of  rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and  times. in the absence of such limitations, the  original author has the right to change his  software back to closed on a whim.   {  david neary makes the point that the copyright  holder automatically retains the right to change  the licence.  scott replies it simply requires authorisation from  all *copyright holders*  that's not my understanding. french law allows a  gpl type licence *_on condition_* that the  specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear - if they are not, there is nothing to stop the original author taking back "his work". the lawyers see this (correctly imho) as a weakness in the gpl).  }    4) hidden defects.  roughly, this clause means that the author(s)  is/are liable for any defects if the consumer  is not an it engineer, so if linux blows up  and data is lost, then the authors are liable.   {  ciaran johnson says that m$oft and others have  similar clauses - the point here is that they  are *_all_* invalid - just that this one  affects the gpl also.  niall o'broinn makes the point that it is not a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement and that's why it doesn't come under this point.  i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software "sales" (even if no money changes hands) as governed very much by consumer law (in france anyway).   rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default.   see the bit about even the granting of  rights by an author having to be  explicitly specified - under french law.   the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that  there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.  }    5) roughly.  there may be other reasons under french  law why the  gpl may be invalid.    -----  whole article. -----------   freedom(a) is worth more than these  imperfect licences.   specialised lawyers look at the gpl.    lawyer cyril rojinsky (duly appointed to  the court) and the jurist vincent grynbaum, both  specialised in the area of intellectual property  examine the "free" licences and in particular the  gpl. they have published their study in the review "proprietes intellectuelles  (intellectual property)[1]" and their conclusion is grim.   their approach is interesting. the problem for  them is not to know whether freedom is valid under  french law (for them the question is a moot point) but rather they asked themselves about the form  and the content of the text of free licences, and  in particular the gpl. the problem is not free  programmes, but rather the licence contracts of  free programmes.    absence of critical clauses.    the authors tell us that first of all, the  reference to "copyright" is not legally  sufficient in the framework of international  contracts  (which is the case of licence  contracts for programmes developed and spread  via the internet). the idea of copyright can  basically include differences from one country  to another. this is why, under international  contracts, it is necessary to specify to which  laws one is referring (french law, american &c.).  the authors only found three public licences  which were correctly formulated on this point:  qpl, ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence).    specification in the english language.    next, the authors remind us that (at least in  france), no clause in a contract may be contrary  to french law [2]. however, it turns out that a  licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law  in several respects. firstly, it is written in  english and the fsf doesn't officially approve  translations.   the "toubon law" obliges this sort  of contract to be written in french, including for  businesses since the notion of "user" applies not  only to consumers, but also to businesses,  professionals &c.    contacted by the editors of linuxfrench,  lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that, as  far as business is concerned, the "toubon  law" is probably doomed to change since  it is in contradiction of european directives  on the subject, but whatever about that, the  problem is still valid for individuals, and  while waiting for it (french law) to change,  french companies have to deal with it, since  it is the law of the land.   a programme under the gpl can suddenly  change licence.   another problem, much more serious, is  that according to french law, the author of  a free programme can, at any time, invoke  the invalidity of the licence for this  software by simply changing the licence.   in effect, the law of intellectual  property stipulates that the granting of   rights by the author is subordinate to  the condition that each of these granted  rights be the object of a distinct clause  in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and  that the granting of any such rights be  delimited with respect to its scope and its  grantees, and also with respect to its  location (i.e. where such rights may be  excersised)  and duration of any such grants.  [3] this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences. briefly, this means  that in france, or elsewhere if the author  is french, that which is under the gpl could  revert to proprietary from one day to the next.      the problem of the guarantee "hidden defects".   an other very serious flaw is that of the  guarantee. the gpl licences and others show  that the software is delivered "without  guarantee". you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the  same clause in their licence contracts, and this is correct. however, whatever is  written in a licence contract, one cannot free oneself from the "guarantee from  hidden defects", since it is imposed in the  civil code. this concept is poorly understood  by the layman, it protects the buyer (whoever it may be, individual or business,  since it specifies the civil code and not  consumer protection law) against hidden  defects, deliberate or made in good faith by  the seller.    for example, if one buys a pair of socks  in a sale, and the shop has a notice  specifying that "sale items are neither  refunded nor exchanged", and on arriving  home you notice that one of the socks has  a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.   you could have checked the socks before  purchase: the flaw is deemed "obvious" and you can sing for your money.   you couldn't check the socks (they were  packaged for example), and in this case,  despite the notice "neither refund nor  exchange", you may invoke "hidden defect"  and have them changed or obtain a refund,  it's up to you.   personally, i have already invoked in shops  the "hidden defect" clause and it always  worked well (shopkeepers are always very  cooperative if you quote a couple of words  of the civil code).    the concept of hidden defect is rather  wide, it is necessary that you hadn't  the possibility of discovering the defect  before buying the product and then  (according to the civil code) that you  wouldn't have bought it at that price if  you had known about the defect.   the third case which is much rarer , is  if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't  inform you. in this case, not only does he  have to reimburse the product, but all  expenses incurred by the sale (metro  tickets to go to the shop, the fuse  which blew when you plugged it in &c.)   this idea of "hidden defect" applies to  all products, including programmes. this  was made abundantly clear by the  authorities (and the courts) surrounding  y2k.   this is particularly inconvenient for  free programmes, since a site which  offers a linux distro for download is  supposed to provide a guarantee against  hidden flaws.   linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if  in the case of a free programme,  one could speak about a "hidden" defect  since the source code was available,  he replied "actually, concerning the  guarantee, the question of obvious  defect will arise. this analyis will  be different depending on whether the  person who downloads the distribution  is an it professional or not".   opensource has this advantage over  the proprietary programme: it protects  the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an  it person. but, for distribution to the  public at large, the problem remains  the same.    roughly speaking.   lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself,  this study is far from being exhaustive  and many other areas could be explored.   during this interview, we asked ourselves,  for example, about the fragility of the  gpl clause which forbids linking source  code under the gpl with proprietary code.   in effect, the laws of intellectual  property give the right to the user  to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability  with another programme. if for that, i need to link with a proprietary library  (communication protocol, device driver) i may consider as "null and void" this  clause of the gpl.   the conclusion of this study is a wake  up call for the community. "freedom"  merits more than these shoddy licences,  which should be modified before court  cases over them proliferate and put at  risk the undeniable originality of  this effort.   ---------------------------   [1] une publication de l'institut  de recherche en propri t   intellectuelle, no4 juillet 2002  [2] une telle clause de contrat  qui est oppos e   ce que dit la loi  fran aise est qualifi e en terme  juridique de   clause r put e  non- crite  , c'est- -dire  qu'on fait comme si cette clause  n' tait pas  crite dans le contrat.   c'est pour cela par exemple que vous  pouvez signer un bail pour un  appartement qui stipule que  les enfants sont interdits dans  l'immeuble, et envisager sans  inqui tude d'avoir quand m me  un enfant, en effet le code civil  stipule que le devoir d'un locataire  d'un appartement doit se comporter  en   bon p re de famille     [3] article l131-3        ___________________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? -- une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en fran ais ! yahoo! mail : http://fr.mail.yahoo.com --  irish linux users' group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information. list maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie

"it looked at me calmly before moving on."  the bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know news shopper had  been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news  of the sighting.  his wife, karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images  of the large cat prowling through their garden.  she said: "i feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat i'd hate  for it to get hurt."  mr gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their  usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at "nothing" in the garden but barked  that morning.  he warned: "i don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they  might jump you."  sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the plumstead  common and shooters hill as well at the bexley area.  if you have seen the big cat, call news shopper on 01689 885712.  12:27 tuesday 8th october 2002    _________________________________________________________________ send and receive hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com   ------------------------ yahoo! groups sponsor ---------------------~-- sell a home for top $ http://us.click.yahoo.com/rrpzmc/jtmeaa/mvfiaa/7gsolb/tm ---------------------------------------------------------------------~-  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: forteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com     your use of yahoo! groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/

easy_ham, from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of adam  l. beberg     if the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so  simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.  ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the ten commandments.  it seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit, too.  in particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into slavery.  certainly the us southerners were particularly sensitive to the term 'man stealer' in a way i didn't understand.  yep, i know he said all holy books.  no, i don't know if this site was blowing hot air.  it just read like someone had done their homework.    http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  
easy_ham,this article from nytimes.com  has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.   texas pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. it's just that knownow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2b portfolio... so far!  rohit  khare@alumni.caltech.edu   texas pacific goes where others fear to spend  august 25, 2002 by riva d. atlas and edward wong         it was one of the first calls david n. siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered us airways last march. seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped through his files and found the number for the texas pacific group, an investment firm headed by david bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies.   mr. siegel, once a top executive at continental airlines, had watched texas pacific's partners turn an investment of $66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600 million. and they had made nearly as much on their stake in america west, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992.   that search for advice turned into an offer. why not let texas pacific have a role in us airways' revival? asked richard schifter, the texas pacific executive whom mr. siegel reached.   in june, mr. siegel called mr. schifter again. and days before us airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated about $550 million in concessions with its unions - texas pacific, based in fort worth and san francisco, agreed to kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy. it also agreed to buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company, and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if us airways emerges from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a better offer.   "one of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were," said james coulter, a partner at texas pacific, in an interview after the bankruptcy filing. "there aren't many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry."   texas pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying businesses no one else wants. mr. coulter and mr. bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990's with investments in continental and america west. the firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements.   now the partners are again looking for trouble. in the last year alone, texas pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions, most in unloved industries like semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. just last month, it announced plans to buy burger king, which has been losing market share, for $2.26 billion. it is also bidding for bankgesellschaft berlin, a large and troubled bank.   the most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these deals could be texas pacific's acquisition last november of memc electronic materials, a semiconductor company, for $6 - yes, just $6 - in cash. it will also guarantee a $150 million bank loan.   in the last few years, most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies - have been largely inactive. falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply. companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze.   texas pacific is different. "this is a terrific environment for them," said stephen schwarzman, chief executive of the blackstone group, which also specializes in buyouts.   mark attanasio, a managing director at trust company of the west, which has invested with texas pacific, said: "most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing. you don't see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes."   like most other buyout firms, texas pacific tries to keep its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant interviews and its web site is perpetually under construction. mr. bonderman, mr. coulter and william price, the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for this article.   mr. bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and bright, patterned socks. "he likes argyle socks, and they tend to fall down around his ankles," said henry miller, an investment banker who advises troubled companies. early in his career, when he was a washington lawyer, mr. bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit.   when a texas pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking in places like pakistan, nepal and, most recently, bhutan. "whenever i see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller i.d., i know it's david calling," said one investment banker who often works with mr. bonderman.   mr. bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the chief investment officer for robert bass, the texas oilman. mr. bonderman enriched mr. bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like american savings & loan, which had been seized by the government. over nearly a decade, mr. bonderman's picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for mr. bass.   in 1993, mr. bonderman struck out on his own with mr. coulter, a former lehman brothers banker who had also worked for mr. bass. they teamed up later that year with mr. price, a veteran of ge capital capital and bain & company, a consulting firm, to form texas pacific.   the three men have complementary skills, investment bankers and other deal makers said. mr. bonderman is the master strategist and mr. coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm's purchases. mr. price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues.   "david is very much the optimist, very much the deal maker," said greg brenneman, a former president of continental. "jim is very much a counterbalance to david. he will sit back and ask the tough questions. he will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than david does."   by the end of the 1990's, texas pacific was well established in deal making. it easily raised $4.5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. to celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented san francisco's city hall and hired the b-52's to play at a party.   but as the stock market began to tumble, texas pacific hesitated. for a 17-month stretch, the partners made no deals. they checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups, including adelphia, xerox and global crossing, but stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable.   instead, texas pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during that stretch.   "they started to cash out early in the cycle," said mario giannini, chief executive of hamilton lane, a money management firm, some of whose clients are texas pacific investors.   the good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for texas pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help.   but texas pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough. it revived oxford health plans, the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems. in 1996, it made a $280 million investment in ducati motor, the italian motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than quadrupled.   but texas pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at the top of the market. texas pacific's $560 million investment in the j. crew group, the clothing retailer, for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997, has been a disappointment. so has its 1999 purchase of bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods.   texas pacific also lost more than $100 million on zilog, a semiconductor company, and favorite brands, a candy maker, both of which filed for bankruptcy.   some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's performance. texas pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade. the first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through march 1997, should return more than 40 percent, according to one texas pacific investor. but its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997 - could return less than half that, this investor estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank.   but because texas pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund, profits on these investments could rebound. it is hoping, for example, that with new management in place, j. crew will turn around as the economy rebounds. in any case, one competitor said, "their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won't return any capital" to investors.   but with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble, texas pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success, the investor said. "they should do exceptionally well," he said.   texas pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. it relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except for surveillance from the boardroom. when necessary, it replaces managers.   less than a year after continental emerged from bankruptcy, for example, mr. bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend robert r. ferguson, the chief executive, led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court.   continental's board, where mr. bonderman was chairman, then brought in gordon m. bethune, an executive at boeing, and in october 1994 he replaced mr. ferguson as chief executive. mr. bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry.   "the biggest conflict i've ever seen was with bob ferguson," said clark onstad, a former general counsel for the federal aviation administration, in describing the thinking of mr. bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982 braniff bankruptcy. "he chose bethune over his longtime friend ferguson because he thought bethune would do a better job."   at america west, texas pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul. this time, the charge was led by mr. coulter and mr. schifter, both directors.   w. douglas parker, the current chief executive, flew to mr. coulter's home in san francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer. they talked for hours, and mr. parker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhat kindred spirits."   the board replaced most senior managers at america west, except william franke, the chief executive, who stepped down last september. his restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in august 1994.   texas pacific owns just 3 percent of america west, worth about $33.7 million. but those are controlling shares, and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes.   "these are not passive investors, nor am i," said donald l. sturm, a denver businessman who serves on continental's board with mr. bonderman and mr. price. "you're active. your money is at stake. your reputation is at stake."   after overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at continental and america west, texas pacific has a good reputation with labor. that was one reason us airways was interested in a texas pacific investment, said chris chiames, a spokesman for the airline.   mr. siegel wanted an investor who would "be as labor friendly as possible," mr. chiames said. but us airways can still entertain other bids this fall, and marvin davis, the billionaire investor from los angeles, has expressed interest.   texas pacific's investment in burger king, made with goldman, sachs and bain capital, was announced after two years of discussions among texas pacific's partners and the chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had been owned by diageo, the liquor company, was put up for sale, said julian josephson, chairman of the national franchisee association, which represents most burger king franchisees.   "we liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy," mr. josephson said. many other owners, he added, "are dismissive of labor."   at burger king, texas pacific will also be working with an executive it knows. burger king's chief executive is john dasburg, the former chief executive of northwest airlines, who met mr. bonderman and his partners when northwest bought out their stake in continental in 1998.   unlike most buyout firms, texas pacific remains enamored with the technology industry, despite the failure of so many start-ups the last two years. it has focused on the semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is highly cyclical. so far, though, results have been mixed.   the firm's 1996 acquisition of the paradyne corporation, which makes equipment for high-speed internet connections, has been a huge success. texas pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment. but a much larger investment, its $400 million acquisition of zilog, the chip maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in asia caused chip prices to plummet. zilog filed for bankruptcy last year.   texas pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company, on semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6 billion three years ago. it invested $100 million more last year.   its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for memc, may prove the most lucrative. the cost of mailing the payment to e.on, based in d sseldorf, germany, was actually more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal said.   texas pacific, and its partners in the deal, trust company of the west and leonard green & partners, agreed to guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. texas pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of which it swapped for more stock in the company.   "they did a good job of timing the acquisition," said nabeel gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted that in the last quarter memc reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000.   but texas pacific's interest in airlines is clearly sizable. besides its involvement in continental, america west and us airways, the company plans to buy gate gourmet, the catering business of the bankrupt swissair group.   two years ago, texas pacific started a web-based discount ticket service called hotwire. it put up most of the $75 million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to invest with it, said karl peterson, the chief executive. hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale.   the contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt hotwire, which is privately owned. mr. peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that texas pacific remains committed to it.   last spring, mr. peterson met mr. bonderman in aspen to talk about hotwire and to go snowboarding. mr. bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany hotwire down the steep internet chute. but he does have his limits on risk, mr. peterson discovered. before going down the mountain, mr. bonderman strapped on a helmet.     http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25texa.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6b    how to advertise --------------------------------- for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media  kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  for general information about nytimes.com, write to  help@nytimes.com.    copyright 2002 the new york times company http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

easy_ham,-----begin pgp signed message----- hash: sha1  thugs of south boston and the revenge of the bandit princess   the geodesic economy robert a. hettinga sunday, august 25, 2002  (boston) when you think about it one way, the fbi/winter hill vs. patriarcha/angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs.  put crudely, and at its most racist, the fbi and the winter hill gang were the (mostly) irish thugs, and patriarcha's "family" were, of course, the (mostly) italian thugs.   think scorsese's upcoming "gangs of new york", only with counter-reformatory overtones. hoover's south boston "social-club" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. the u.s. federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by the italians from the irish. the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york, but for south boston, the most irish place in the us, only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all.  the result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone. hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine - -- or, more properly, pcp. the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of boston's drug markets, like the identical fbi-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also-rans in cities across the us as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points.  as stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. and, make no mistake, j. edgar hoover was directly responsible that "quality" of carnage, nation-wide.   so, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like mr. salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of "justice" like so much hamburger.  however, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was "greasing", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence -- on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door, but still elitist, will to power of h.l. mencken's famous "bluenoses and busybodies".   it all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. what she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling mrs. grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, "manageable" demand. the bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.  every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now, apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years. a *larger* market than before the prohibition. hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly-legislated "barriers to competition" imposed on them by the state. increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. and, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.  as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. in some twisted corollary to parkinson's law, governments, to survive, *need* more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time.  and, to bring us back to the point, david friedman would probably echo here his father milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. even, *especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us.   and there, absent the apparent grace of mr. hoover, went mr. salvati.  in fact, hayek himself, in "the road to serfdom", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover's blatant imposition, "for our own good", of vietnam-era statist power at the neighborhood level. and, furthermore, *stalin* couldn't have had better "useful idiots" than hoover did -- and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did whitey bulger after hoover.  useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. idiots who were eating out of hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century -- and whitey bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. a time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of "mob" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting, movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, nazi-appeasing irish-bostonian little caesar. or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now strictly political, descendents.  in terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to mr. salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a "transfer-price", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of macnamara-style vietnam-era keynesian "social-cost" input-output accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in boston.   this shouldn't be a surprise, really. all race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the "right" people, for all the "right" reasons.  as far as the fbi itself goes, remember mancur olson's observation that a "prince" is just a stationary bandit.  though,

"patriarca ultimately furnished this o.k.," the f.b.i. reported, and three days later mr. deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times.  it was an extraordinary situation: the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved.  but when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers - who also happened to be informers for the f.b.i. - were left alone. four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it.  one, joseph salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f.b.i. for $300 million for false imprisonment.  his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f.b.i., the justice department and some f.b.i. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f.b.i.'s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob.  the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry. but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which mr. patriarca approved the murder. they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f.b.i in boston.  the documents show that officials at f.b.i. headquarters, apparently including mr. hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution.  "j. edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself," said vincent garo, mr. salvati's lawyer. "he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants."  mr. barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr. salvati and may have implicated him because mr. salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for mr. barboza.  asked about the documents showing that mr. hoover knew of mr. salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, gail marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the f.b.i. in boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.  a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office. in one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, john j. connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f.b.i. informers, james bulger and stephen flemmi. vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers.  the government reform committee, led by representative dan burton, republican of indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr. barboza were involved in killing mr. deegan. a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot.  then, on june 4, 1965, mr. hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer.  in a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr. flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr. patriarca "potentially could be an excellent informant."  the agent also informed mr. hoover that mr. flemmi was known to have killed seven men, "and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder." nevertheless, the agent said, "the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved."  a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. "the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond," the investigator said. "there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."  the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr. hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia, which he had largely ignored. in boston, f.b.i. agents recruited mr. barboza and mr. flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the winter hill gang, led by mr. bulger.  both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of mr. connolly. the f.b.i. got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in new england. mr. bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the f.b.i. looked the other way.  one reason the f.b.i. may not have used its information about mr. patriarca's involvement in the deegan murder, congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence, r.i., headquarters. the f.b.i. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say.  mr. salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by gov. william f. weld. last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a massachusetts state judge after the justice department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence.  two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. their survivors have joined the fourth man, peter limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the justice department. mr. limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. his life was spared only when massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.  mr. salvati lives in a modest apartment in boston's north end with his wife, marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. each week mr. salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. it was, mr. garo said, all they had of each other.  -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5  iqa/awubpwmb2spxh8jf3ohaeql9qgcgxhq0ee06uesnv8u8wgvmjf9k7s4an3rb 3srsgomwjndwiakoehofnhpi =oeld -----end pgp signature-----  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire' http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

 sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?  i don't buy it.  for most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism.  for some messages, pictures do the job, but i would say not nearly as often as words.  why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games?  because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across.  misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, sms didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality, sms cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.  again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with "you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this").  i wasn't saying that mms wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy.  i was saying that i couldn't see why people would use it in a way that "changed the face of communications".  i'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this.  sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people.  but, mostly, i don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum.  i don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  people want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  that's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  the instant view part.  i'm guessing your argument is that people not only want "instant view", but also "instant show".  which is what this service offers.  i'm not convinced that most people want "instant show".  i think people like to package their pictures and show them.  that's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture.  sure, occasionally "instant show" is nice, but it's just "nice" on occasion.  i still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method.  what's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another?  there has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it.  i'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.  the *only* really intriguing idea i've heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there.  willing to be proven wrong, mike  ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then mms is *never* going to catch on.  http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

easy_ham,--------------------------------------------------------------------------  what is mime?  mime stands for "multipurpose internet mail extensions".  it is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide internet email system.  typical uses of mime include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file.  mime also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them.   how can i read a mime message?  since mime is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand mime messages.  however, there are a growing number of mail programs that have mime support built-in.  (one popular mime-capable mailer for unix, vms and pcs is pine, developed at the university of washington and available via anonymous ftp from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.z)  in addition, several proprietary email systems provide mime translation capability in their internet gateway products.  however, even if you do not have access to a mime-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope!   there are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a mime message.  one of the more versatile is called "munpack".  it was developed at carnegie mellon university and is available via anonymous ftp from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  there are versions available for unix, pc, mac and amiga systems.  for compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format.   does mime replace uuencode?  yes.  uuencode has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems.  mime uses a more robust encoding called "base64" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways.   how can i learn more about mime?  the mime internet standard is described in rfc-1521, available via anonymous ftp from many different internet hosts, including:                                                               o  us east coast                                     address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)                                                                       o  us west coast                                     address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)                                                                     o  pacific rim                                       address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)                                                                 o  europe                                            address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17)   look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt  another source of information is the internet news group "comp.mail.mime", which includes a periodic posting of a "frequently asked questions" list.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

easy_ham,hi kragen,     this is an interesting analysis.  i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick (for example, i don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), i think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over.  i know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.     there's one other point which you don't make, which i think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code.  i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions.     i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have stackguard, its4, nissus, or snort.  and the security admin's job would be a lot harder.  adam   on thu, aug 22, 2002 at 08:42:12am +0200, eugen leitl wrote: | --  | -- eugen* leitl leitl | ______________________________________________________________ | icbmto: n48 04'14.8'' e11 36'41.2'' http://eugen.leitl.org | 83e5ca02: ede4 7193 0833 a96b 07a7  1a88 aa58 0e89 83e5 ca02 |  |  | ---------- forwarded message ---------- | date: thu, 22 aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (edt) | from: kragen sitaker  | to: fork@example.com | subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards |  | on august 7th, an entity known as "idefense" sent out an announcement, | which is appended to this email.  briefly, "idefense", which bills | itself as "a global security intelligence company", is offering cash | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell | anyone else. |  | if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. |  | at the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research | known as "full disclosure"; people who discover security | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the | vulnerability, if possible.   |  | this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by | cert in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call "responsible | disclosure" --- never release working exploit code, and never release | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released | a patch.  this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem | was. |  | the underground computer criminal community would often discover and | exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible | disclosure" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the | underground, vulnerable. |  | the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and | detecting and responding to intrusions.  they are therefore much less | useful to would-be intruders.  also, software companies usually see | security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems, and so | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as | long as possible. |  | idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous | than either of the two previous paradigms.  they want to be a buyer in | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.   |  | not long before, snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to | hewlett-packard to keep a vulnerability in hp's tru64 unix secret if | hp retained snosoft's "consulting services".  hp considered this | extortion and responded with legal threats, and snosoft published the | information. |  | if this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, | together, add up to a catastrophe. |  | first, secret software vulnerability information will be available to | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  for reasons explained later, | i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. |  | second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will | become lucrative for many more talented people.  the result will be | --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. |  | i've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the | vendors of the vulnerable software, but i don't think that's | plausible.  if someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. | knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some | negative pr, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. |  | i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  inevitably, that | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who | are good at networked theft may not yet exist. |  | there might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as | microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr | than a gang could make by theft.  think of a remote-root hole in | samba, for example. |  | right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  creating | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly | increase the availability of that information to the people who can | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. |  | let's not let that happen. |  |  |  |  | this is the original idefense announcement: |  | from: sunil james [mailto:sjames@idefense.com] | sent: wednesday, august 07, 2002 12:32 pm | subject: introducing idefense's vulnerability contributor program |  |  | greetings, |  | idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability | contributor program (vcp). the vcp pays contributors for the advance | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. |  | idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp. the following | provides answers to some basic questions about the program: |  | q. how will it work? | a. idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish | security research for compensation;

"with these sort of things you have to find some process that would accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to crash," he said. "once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit it."  he said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system. he said the problem was easy to fix by "writing protective code around that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that piece."  "because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these buffer overflows and exploits out there now," said banes.  cerulean studios, creator of trillian, was contacted for comment but had not responded by the time of publication.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  for all security-related news, including updates on the latest viruses, hacking exploits and patches, check out zdnet uk's security news section.  have your say instantly, and see what others have said. go to the security forum.  let the editors know what you think in the mailroom.  copyright   2002 cnet networks, inc. all rights reserved.  zdnet is a registered service mark of cnet networks, inc. zdnet logo is a service mark of cnet networks, inc. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"a fool and his money are soon parted" and all that.  it isn't the job of the ftc/sec/irs/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and i have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).     they   finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off   hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.   so what?  nobody is guaranteed employment.  laying people off is not a crime nor is it immoral.  companies don't exist to provide employment, nor should they.  the closest we have to such a thing in the us is a government job, and look at the quality that breeds.     so.. tell me again.. how are we better off?   perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but i'd rather not live in a "feed lot" society, thank-you-very-much.   -james rogers  jamesr@best.com

easy_ham, bottom line: the late senate minority leader certainly would have   endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he   ever coined it.  an interesting link courtesy of the harrow report: there's no written  evidence so far that senator everett dirksen is the source of the  infamous quote attributed to him. it's kind of astounding that there is  enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very*  faq) and "eyewitness" reporting without a single written source. what  the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest  attributed quote in print by any other writer is. i'd naturally be much  more skeptical if the "quote" emerged after his death... rk  =============================================================== http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresbillionhere.htm  "a billion here, a billion there . . ."  did dirksen ever say, " a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon  you're talking real money"? (or anything very close to that?)  perhaps not. based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio  records of the dirksen congressional center, staffers there have found  no evidence that dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to  him.  archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics  showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote  or its variations.  here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed  "ev and charlie" and "ev and jerry" shows, all newspapers clippings in  the dirksen papers, about 12,500 pages of dirksen's own speech notes,  transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of  republican leadership press conferences, and dirksen's statements on the  senate floor as documented in the congressional record.  although dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to  rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular  turn of phrase. for example, in referring to the public debt or  excessive government spending, dirksen would jot the word "pothole" to  remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to  the debt ceiling:   "as i think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make  the deeper we go into the hole, i am reminded of a group of men who were  working on a street. they had dug quite a number of holes. when they got  through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to  the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic  hazard.  "not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a  conference. after a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and  said,  i have it. i know how we will get rid of that overriding earth  and remove the hazard. we will just dig the hole deeper.'"  [congressional record, june 16, 1965, p. 13884].   on the same occasion, dirksen relied on yet another "spending" story,  one he labeled "cat in the well":   "one time in the house of representatives [a colleague] told me a story  about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. he said,  johnny, a cat  fell in a well 100 feet deep. suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and  then fell back 2 feet. how long would it take the cat to get out of the  well?'  "johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a  while, and then when the teacher came down and said,  how are you  getting along?' johnny said,  teacher, if you give me another slate and  a couple of slate pencils, i am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes  i can land that cat in hell.'  "if some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, i do  not find much to cheer about concerning it." [congressional record, june  16, 1965, p. 13884].   but there are no such reminders for the "a billion here, a billion  there . . . " tag line as there surely should have been given dirksen's  note-making tendencies. he spoke often and passionately about the debt  ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. yet there is no  authoritative reference to the "billion" phrase.  the chief evidence in support of dirksen making the statement comes from  people who claim to have heard him. the library of congress, for  example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as  evidence. the dirksen center has received calls from people who heard  dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. but  cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up  nothing in the way of confirmation.  the closest documented statement came at a joint senate-house republican  leadership press conference on march 8, 1962, when dirksen said, "the  favorite sum of money is $1 billion   a billion a year for a fatter  federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there." [emd papers,  republican congressional leadership file, f. 25] but the "and pretty  soon you're talking real money" is missing.  in another close call, the new york times, january 23, 1961, quoted  dirksen: "look at education   two-and-one-half billion   a billion for  this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. three to five  billion for public works. you haven't got any budget balance left.  you'll be deeply in the red." [cited in byron hulsey's "everett dirksen  and the modern presidents," ph.d. dissertation (may 1998, university of  texas, p. 226]  of course, the dirksen papers do not document completely the late  senator's comments. for example, the center that bears his name does not  have his testimony before committees. their collection of congressional  records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of dirksen's life and  career   he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses  claim he said it throughout his career. dirksen's campaign speeches  tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated  newspaper accounts. dirksen also held center stage before the video age,  meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped  capture.  bottom line: the late senate minority leader certainly would have  endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he  ever coined it.       --- my permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu

easy_ham, now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used  on all transaction in order to process them... so this has some preaty heavy  implications, unless it's just bs.  anybody buying a box like this is undoubtledly going to integrate it into their crypto infrastructure.  what's the point of putting in a box like this if it's not an active participant in your security framework?   or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. nah! (that was the  whole point of xml afterall, to sell more cpus - much like oracle's use of  java allows them to sell 3x more cpu licenses due to the performance hit)  blah, blah, blah.  the marketing fud gets compounded by the beberg fud, talk about 20x bloat.   again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...  what gives you the impression that's what they're doing?  that's not what the text says.  it's largely fluff anyway.    "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  mmmmmmmmmmm, machine code, never a good idea ;)  uhhh, fundamentally it's all machine code.  kelly's comment seems more like drivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern.  having what appears to be a silicon xml router would be a cool thing.  having one integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass.  let it deserialize/decrypt/repackage the xml before handing it off to the app servers. the question, of course, is does it work with actual applications in the field without tremendously reworking them.  somehow i doubt it...  -bill kearney

"reliability" is more a function of the software engineer.  i've written complicated mission-critical server software in java that will run without a hiccup as long as the unix box it is sitting on is running.  same with c.  for processes that are running months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a design/programming issue.  that said, we usually prototype serious systems in java and then re-implement them in c if we have time.  java doesn't scale well as a language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered.  the problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give you access to it.  you can squeeze several times the performance out of a c server program than a java one simply by being able to finely tune (or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management.  nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by raw performance scalability.   -james rogers  jamesr@best.com

"duncan" beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com  -----------------  tech's major decline college students turning away from bits and bytes  by ellen mccarthy washington post staff writer tuesday, august 27, 2002; page e01  if john yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have sought a stake in the "new" economy. he might have dreamed of becoming an ace code-cracker for the cia or the national security agency, or imagined toppling an empire with revolutionary software. maybe he would have tried to use the internet to end world hunger.  but as yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring different academic ambitions. the ashburn native says he wants to do something more social and more interesting than working with computers.  besides, he said while packing for a charlottesville dormitory room, "you can't get the chicks with that anymore."  the tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of some fair-weather students. but now there's another consequence of the tech bust: enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt.  the number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in 2001, according to a report by the computing research association. and educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.  the word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled into the classroom, said maria clavez, president of the association of computing machinery.  "i've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines," said clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january. "it can be hard to see this, because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space. [but] it is going to have an effect."  at virginia tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. at george washington university, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year.  interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade. in 1997, schools with phd programs in computer science and computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the computing research association. the numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees were awarded.  the labor department projects that software engineering will be the fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other computer-related industries trailing close behind.  but in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among college students. for example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year. this year the enrollment in that major is down to 800, although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted 200 students.  "having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief," said lloyd griffith, dean of george mason's information technology and engineering school. "particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four years on something and then not get a job."  freshman enrollment for the university of maryland's computer science major is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does not account for the drop, said steve halperin, dean of maryland's college of computer, mathematical and physical sciences.  "we are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major," halperin said. "that's a factual statement. but i would say that at this point . . . we don't expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates. many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in cs would have fallen off."  yandziak, who began at the university of virginia on saturday, is not convinced that's the case. he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class, with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his advanced-placement exam in computer science.  "all of my classes have been easy for me. math and sciences were always fun, so i looked for professions in which i could use those things," yandziak said. "i'm just not sure i want my life to be immersed in [technology]. i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world."  harris n. miller, president of the information technology association of america, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals, salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.  "there was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now. people are saying, 'i don't need this kind of it training right now,' " miller said. "our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation."  economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social influences, also come into play, said judy hingle, director of professional development at the american college counseling association. the perception of computer science as an isolating, "nerdy" profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch. that stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.  "all the hipness is gone," yandziak said. "once we thought of the internet as this thing with infinite capabilities. it was basically just a fad that came along."  lamont thompson, a recent graduate of calvin coolidge senior high school in the district, is headed to morehouse college in atlanta to study business marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.  "technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore," thompson said. "to be honest with you, when i think computer science, i think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. it's a necessity, but i wouldn't take it any further."

or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal c/c++ code?  for example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?

(aside to the minimal ansi stuff).  is there a standard way of dealing with c/c++ applications for various domain problems (messaging, database persistence, etc.) that rivals java?  i'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes c/c++... in that case, i claim ignorance...  not suggesting that java is the golden hammer.... just that c/c++ is overkill for most things... i even coded in vb... but vb is a true disgrace to programming... it's just lame... java is object oriented... (no flame-mail from the anti-oo people please... that is a religious discussion...) and relatively clean... and i don't think that every "kid" can write a well designed java program.  kids typically don't understand various design patterns and principles... to my experience, they actually tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, imho, in c/c++ than in java due to existence of standard api's.

easy_ham,sunday i drove from portland down to the woodburn dragstrip to check out  the nedra nationals.   the electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and i  ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...  john waylan (who was interviewed in wired a few years back) pulled out a  14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that  hasn't been broken in yet. he expects to break his record next year  topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. he's shooting for a  12 second run.  john also took out a replica 1908 oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph  run.

easy_ham,thanks tony, but i think doing it using component files will get a .signature  by default, but i have many diferent signatures and i want to insert one of  that signatures using a keyboard command. so for a message i will insert a  signature, but for another message i will insert a different signature.  is it possible? i am using sedit for my messages.  thanks. ulises    hi!      is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not   to have sent the mail to insert it then?    i simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,  replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  that way you get them when you are  editing your message.  also, by using comps files for specific  folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  see  the docs for (n)mh for all the details.    there might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but i've  been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  i  load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,  to "syntax" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an  email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add  a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).    and there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...  somewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:  rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/signature_finger_faq.

you could watch a live video webcast while waiting  for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or  download the mp3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.  this is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the  third-generation (3g) mobile phone companies have been promoting for  years. 3g services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new  technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision  sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever  dream.  two companies, us startup meshnetworks and moteran networks of germany,  are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking.  instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications,  with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time  "mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, pdas, laptops - are in close  proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh  network. every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying  traffic for everyone else. traffic hops from person to person until it  reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central  antennas, and improving wireless coverage.  as the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless pdas, laptops, and  other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless  networking may be inevitable.  mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3g wireless  networks. while 3g operators roll out mobile services that offer users  connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a  dial-up modem), moteran and meshnetworks are able to offer connection  speeds of up to 6mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. the  technologies they use include wi-fi - the emerging standard for high-speed  wireless networking also known as 802.11b. a similarly short-range  protocol called ultrawideband, which is poised to succeed wi-fi, is even  faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 mbps.  the range of a typical wi-fi network is generally too limited to be of  much use when travelling around a city. mesh networks get around the  problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic.  even though the range of any individual device is relatively small,  because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area,  connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3g wireless  connection.  because mesh networks use wi-fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed  to create them is cheap and readily available. instead of building  cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all  that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around   100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the  proper software. existing laptops and pdas can be mesh-enabled by  software.  it also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network.  unlike with 3g cellular, the part of the spectrum that wi-fi operates on  is unregulated in the us, britain. the mobile phone companies are none too  pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds  acquiring 3g licences.  all that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect  to the network. with every additional customer that signs up coverage gets  better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone  networks.  but things get very interesting when you realise that when you have  high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, pdas,  and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing  music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. when  ultrawideband hits, all of this will just accelerate.  at 400mbps, copying a pirated copy of the lord of the rings from the  person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds.  sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of  their favourite songs, movies, and video games.  but the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers.  meshnetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service.  instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities  that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works  employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the  cheap. moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for  enterprise networks.  the first place average users may use the technology is when it is  incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at  high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.  when will you be able to wander around town with a 6mbps connection in  your pocket? it's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service  was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually  someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

easy_ham,congrats, in the end...  "if they didn't have max, they might have succumbed, because paypal was   susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and max tightened them up,"  http://www.infoworld.com/articles/ct/xml/02/09/02/020902ctspotlight.xml  secure and at ease by jack mccarthy august 30, 2002 1:01 pm pt  max levchin's fascination with encryption started when he was a teenager  in kiev, ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the united states  where he attended the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. in  late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to  co-found paypal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens  of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier internet  transaction processor. now online auction house ebay has acquired his  company for a king's ransom.  not bad for a 27-year-old kid from ukraine.  a programmer since he was 10 years old, levchin and his family moved to  chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a  mission. he created a startup right out of college to build secure  passwords for palm pilots. he met peter thiel, and the two founded  paypal to target online payment security. thiel is now ceo of the  company.  "this company was founded on the notion of security value," levchin  says. "peter thiel and i shared that vision from the very beginning."  thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas levchin remains  focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good  fortune.  "i explain [paypal] as a security company posing as a transaction  processor," levchin says. "we spend a lot of time designing security so  it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around.  the trade-off is fundamental."  mountain view, calif.-based paypal allows businesses and consumers with  e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the internet,  accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. the  service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and  more than 3 million business accounts.  most of paypal's users are participants in online auctions, which led  paypal to be closely linked with ebay, the leading web auction site.  although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two  companies resulted july 8 in ebay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition  of paypal. the agreement is subject to regulatory review.  levchin says he will stay at paypal as it merges with ebay. "there are  areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."  although security is a dominant feature for paypal, the company's  ability to carry out open communications among the millions of  participants fits the growing web services model, levchin says.  "this is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to  one another," he says. levchin is a panelist at infoworld's  next-generation web services ii conference sept. 20  paypal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. and  levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on  exploiting the system, says avivah litan, a vice president and analyst  covering financial services at stamford, conn.-based gartner.  "if they didn't have max, they might have succumbed, because paypal was  susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and max tightened them up,"  litan says.  to combat criminals, levchin established "igor," an antifraud program  that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. levchin  says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. "the  work i do is important to paypal and to consumers in general because the  work makes internet shopping safe. it's the view that ecommerce has  arrived."

"duncan" beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com  --------  epa: diesel exhaust can cause cancer wed sep 4, 3:29 am et by h. josef hebert, associated press writer  washington (ap) - inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an environmental protection agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.  the epa finding, released tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.  while acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the epa report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans.  "it is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels" as well, the report said. "the potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved."  the report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in california and is particularly significant because the epa is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the clean air act.  some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the bush administration might try to back away from a clinton-era regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.  epa administrator christie whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules. last month, with white house approval, the epa rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an october deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.  the engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road, although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions.  the epa's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to diesel exhaust. such a risk assessment is commonly made by the epa when gauging pollution health concerns.  but in this case, the report said, "the exposure-response data are considered too uncertain" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual.  nevertheless, said the report, the "totality of evidence from human, animal and other supporting studies" suggests that diesel exhaust "is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure."  the report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a "chronic respiratory hazard to humans" contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems. in some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.  environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road diesel-powered vehicles. epa spokeswoman steffanie bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.  emily figdor of the u.s. public interest research group, a private environmental organization, said: "to reduce the public's exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the bush administration should ... fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."  allen schaeffer, executive director of the industry group diesel technology forum, said the epa's report "focused on the past," whereas "the future is clean diesel. diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago."  the report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.    
easy_ham,hindus mourn 'monkey god'   by omer farooq bbc reporter in hyderabad  hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a hindu god in the southern indian state of andhra pradesh.   the monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed  animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.  the animal was cremated in anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles) south of the state capital, hyderabad, on sunday.  it had not eaten for three weeks.  last rites were performed by priests in the village of timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the hindu monkey god, hanuman.  garlanded  one animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people.   the monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.  the monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of hanuman a month ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages, as well as from the neighbouring state of karnataka.  devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock.  'exploited'  locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents.  but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated.  they filed a petition in the state's high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple.  the group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being exploited to make money.  the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

easy_ham,so, like many young children, my daughter tatum (age 21 months) *really* likes music. she also likes to have control over her environment, and this means she wants to be the one putting cds into the cd player, and getting the music playing.  by watching tatum, i've discovered that you can learn a lot about ui design from watching 21-month-olds use technology. there is definitely a market niche for a toddler-friendly cd/mp3 player.  the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. this is a ui disaster. since tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the button again, thereby pausing the cd before it even plays. she'll only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. this happens a surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesn't play.  for toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately, within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the button multiple times. as well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't change the semantics, like an elevator button. no matter how many times you press, the elevator still comes to that floor. the play button needs to be the same.  the back-hinged door mechanism feeding the cd into the player is also a ui disaster for tatum. since the door hinges on the back, tatum has to angle cds to put them in, and take them out. putting cds in isn't much of a problem, but taking them out is. since tatum grabs cds by the back edge, that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. tatum eventually forces and wiggles the cd out, a process that's hard on the cd and the player (but which hasn't yet resulted in the cd player being broken). surprisingly, it hasn't been a problem getting the cd hole onto the spindle -- tatum seems to understand this concept, and the cd load area geometry naturally guides the cd.  tatum's cd player also plays tapes and has fm radio. for a toddler, this is a mistake. tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the player into a specific mode. she understands putting a cd in, and pressing the play button. she sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song, but uses them erratically. as well, the radio feature has both fm mono and fm stero, a distinction totally lost on tatum. tatum only understands the binary distinction of music/no music.  what would the ideal toddler cd player be like? it would immediately start playing a cd after it was loaded. as soon as the cd load door was closed, it would give some audible feedback. it would have a single large play button. the other typical cd controls would be larger than normal, but at least half the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play. the play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of the player, and different from the color of the other cd control keys. the device would only play cds, no other functions. the cd load area would flip open at least 80 degrees. it should be small, approachable for a toddler. it should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2' without affecting the player.  - jim     
easy_ham, our preschoolers (2 and 4) use winamp with a pokemon skin.  it's the 2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all he need do is click there to launch their favourite mp3 playlist.  what /we/ need is a good "barely literate" email program.  years ago the university of hawaii had a word processor that included a voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as words were typed; even further back there was a dos shareware editor that did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the handicapped).  with just those little bits of assists, maybe some clever use of pictograms too, i bet kindergarten kids could handle email.  --  gary lawrence murphy  teledynamics communications inc  business advantage through community software : http://www.teledyn.com "computers are useless.  they can only give you answers."(pablo picasso)

(except on operating systems where select() isn't a system call but a library routine that calls poll().)    very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only   high-performance rdbms servers even benefit from them at all, and   most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple   threads or processes.  this just provides a modicum of extra   performance.    wrong, it makes a huge difference in even what i consider small programs.  why don't you explain this in more detail?    although i don't have a copy of the spec handy, i think the aio_* apis   come from the posix spec ieee std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is   13 years old, and which i think documented then-current practice.   they might be even older than that.    yes, sgi has a patch to the linux kernel to implement the aio_ interfaces,  but it's still not built in, who knows when it will be. the point is it's  not portable in either case.  you originally said:    could it be? after 20 years without this feature unix finally   catches up to windows and has i/o that doesnt [sic] totally suck for   nontrivial apps? no way!  the point --- my point, the point i was discussing; please don't try to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because i don't care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; unix hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't "totally suck for nontrivial apps".  for what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of concurrent i/o requests.  i find references to the glibc implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and i could probably find much earlier references if i had time: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html  (more details at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html; details on the sgi patch are at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html)    unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most unix implementations   have supported multithreading for a decade or more.    and most unix is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (posix)  interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation. you're safe if you  stick to the basics.  your original complaint was that unix didn't do multithreading or multiprogramming well.  now that i've pointed out how obviously idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although individual unixes do these things well, you complain that their implementations are not entirely conformant with the posix threads specification.  well, that's probably true, but i haven't written pthreads programs in c much myself, so i can't confirm it from my own experience.  but, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to prefer windows.  i'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading implementations.  spare us.  just shut up.  --         kragen sitaker      edsger wybe dijkstra died in august of 2002.  the world has lost a great man.  see http://advogato.org/person/raph/diary.html?start=252 and http://www.kode-fu.com/geek/2002_08_04_archive.shtml for details.

(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed btw)  most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. even 10 seconds is pushing the "capactior is the wrong choice" limits. thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve.  but it should be safe to say that most people want the indy 500 version, not the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) for those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. however, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.  - adam l.

"i knew i found her attractive. i could tell straight away that she was very caring."  moylan spent a week in thailand, and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail. six months later she came to england and the couple married.  mr. marriage  lawrence lynch, 49, runs thai professional introduction services, the agency moylan used to meet his wife. lynch, who calls himself "mr. marriage," started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency.  since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.  "in the last five years we've done about 400," he said. "to the best of my knowledge, they have all been successful."  male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband. if they like what they see they come to bangkok.  clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch's office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems.  "we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies," lynch said. "but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."  after the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better. within two weeks of arrival, lynch says, almost every client has found a potential wife.  "at the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn't made his mind up," he said. in most cases, marriage follows, usually within the next year.  roongthip kamchat, managing director of thai no. 1 connections, a bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less than 10 percent have broken up.  roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife.  "sometimes they are very nervous," she said. "and sometimes they are very impatient and say 'give me a lady, i want to get married now.' i say: 'calm down, ok, we'll talk."'  but if men are really in a hurry, roongthip says, she can find them a wife and get them married within a week. lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic stress disorder.  why?  similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west.  but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is no reason to object. "if you talk about people who are needy, i think everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, i need wan," he said.  "thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand. i think there's no secret there. they are looking for a better life. i don't have a problem with that. in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband."  lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too, and that is why they choose to use his agency.  his brochure promises an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the british singles scene," and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not "god's gift to women."  roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries -- and found thai women attractive.  "they don't know how to meet women. even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? impossible," she said.  "many thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. they are good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. different from ladies from other countries."  although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, the agencies say this is not a problem. they say language problems are also not a major obstacle.  "thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older," lynch said. "when i met my wife she couldn't speak a word of english. we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary. the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly."  many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west.  "we have kitchens, we have study classes," roongthip said. "we teach them how to eat, and when to make tea."  pitfalls  but not all dreams come true. "bee" is a 26-year-old thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. now she is back in bangkok, sad and angry.  "he had no friends, and i was so lonely," she said. "i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. he never spoke to me."  bee came back to bangkok earlier this year. "i thought i would be happy there," she said. "but it was the worst time of my life."  lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out.  "we are ethical and professional," he said. "we will not take on all comers."  moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work. wan's sister has just signed up with lynch's company, looking for a foreign husband.  "perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. i'm sure there are," moylan said. "but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."

easy_ham,lol!  they're not doomed at all.  thousands of men wear cb2000s to work  every day (along with other chastity devices).    they are not just  decorations.  you will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your  keyholder allows you to.  anyhow, i know better than to have this  type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and  consensually.  (:  there is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the  people who use these.  there is power exchange instead.  lots of  variations on the definition, but this one's from gloria brame's site:  power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the  dominant. the exchange takes place when the returned energy from the  dominant empowers the submissive.   anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares  to read them, but i assure you, the chastity device business is doing very  well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  it's not coercion,  it is creative sensuality.

easy_ham,this is preaty neat.  - adam l. "duncan" beberg   http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/   beberg@mithral.com  pitch dark bar opens for blind dates thu sep 5,10:09 am et  berlin (reuters) - diners at berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the bar is pitch black.  the restaurant, which opened wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on senses other than sight.  holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter roland zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. although the phd student has been blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery and drinks.  "i'm putting your plate right in front of you," zimmermann said. "i can't find my mouth," one voice replied out of the dark. "i wonder what this dish is -- lasagne? or some casserole?" another invisible guest said.  in the "unsicht-bar," which means invisible in german, diners cannot choose complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like a fish, meat or vegetarian option.  "we want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and smelling," said manfred scharbach, head of the organization for blind and sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.  "people are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent," he added.  of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.  an average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to help, scharnbach said.  and at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have actually been eating.

easy_ham, related anecdote:  i was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in boston.  the place was empty.   the only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language  newspaper.  the guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.   eventually his story came out.  he had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.   after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left him, leaving no contact information.  he was hanging around in chinatown, asking random asians for help finding her.  i obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.  anecdote number two:  in college i had a job as a street vendor.  there was a guy i worked with who was a lifer in the job.  he was a noticably messed up guy.  among other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like offering them flowers.  i asked him about it.  he said that he'd never had sex with a woman who wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a mail order bride.  i was really moved.  the guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.

easy_ham, clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have  resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,  dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our  demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places  with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).   at least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and  counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing  something wrong.  there was a fascinating article in the economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue with a pregnant-looking statue of liberty on the front) that stated that even for the native us population, fertility had jumped in the last decade and a half. i think the current figure for the us is a little over 2, but not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. combined with the very fertile non-native population, the article implied the us was going to have a significant increase in population over earlier predictions. as well, the population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending, etc.  europe did not show the same increase in fertility.  some actual data for the us are here:  http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf part of: http://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html  - jim

easy_ham,   wrong, [vms-like async io] makes a huge difference in even what i  consider small programs.  so it sounds as if, to your thinking, most useful apps are also trivial.  unless each key on my keyboard were (to the apps) distinct event sources, i can't think of any of my usual job mix that would need hundreds, or even tens, of async requests; perhaps you can explain how nontrivial apps will be compellingly useful?    but it's still not built in, who knows when it will be. the point is it's  not portable in either case.  does that lack of portability imply it isn't generally useful?  (when it was apparent that tcp networks were useful, berkeley sockets could be found even on vms and win 3.1 boxen)  why would early unix have run with the idea that, if one wishes to do multiple things at the same time, one can use a group of processes to do them?  - they had multics as a counterexample?  - in the days of tiny memories and tapes,   people were more accustomed to writing   programs that didn't run entirely in a   single address space?  - one is a great number for an interface,   as log(1) is 0, and specification can   be implicit?  - some combination of the above?  now, as hoare says:  there are two ways of constructing a software design.  one way is to make  it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to  make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.  as programmers, we've been able to make our lives complicated for at least half a century; the hardware interrupt gives us the rope.  part of dijkstra's inspiration for the was the counterexample of ibm's multi- programmed boxes (were these the same ones that inspired mythical man month?) and i suppose he would say the question is how not to make a mess of it -- how should we structure computations so if we try to do ten times as many things at the same time, reasoning about the resulting system is at most ten times more complex -- not one hundred, and certainly not three and a half million times more.  compared to that project, the prospect of writing a driver library for various vendors' aio implementations seems to be truly trivial.  -dave  (oracle, in their quest for portability, used to use raw disks for the database. this finessed the filesystem issue; did it also allow them to roll their own set of async drivers?)

easy_ham,definitional nit to pick:  robert harley writes:  it is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,  precisely identical between males and females.    of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.  you've redefined "promiscuity" above as "total" or "average"  activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning:  activity above some specific threshold (usually "one") or  norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety.  "promiscuity" is thus inherently a description of  distributions rather than averages.  consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. then, let one of the males also have  sex with the other two females.   sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically.   but here more women than men are:  - above the single partner threshold  - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold  - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners  - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners  and here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2)  number of partners.  so in this contrived population, females are more  "promiscuous" than males, unless "promiscuity" is  defined uselessly.  - gordon

("he was promiscuous in college. he is no longer promiscuous.")  the word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency  to gloss that meaning over with population averages.    consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.  [...]  so in this contrived population, females are more "promiscuous" than males,    so 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy  gets 3 girls.  sounds like six of one versus half a dozen of the other  to me.  ok, then. consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each pair off with 500,000 women. then, 1 man, let's call him "wilt", also has sex with the other 499,999 women.   499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have only had one partner. it is now "perfectly obvious" that in the common meaning of the term, among this contrived population,  that women are "more promiscuous" than men -- even though the single "most promiscuous" person, wilt, is a man.    "promiscuity" is not "exactly, perfectly identical between males  and females", except under a degenerate custom definition of "promiscuity".   unless "promiscuity" is defined uselessly.    ain't nothin' useless about averages.  averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their  actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.  - gordon

easy_ham,here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with  no reference to sexual preference that i could find. the point would seem to  be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la  wilt chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts,  ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more  partners than women.  i have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether  the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely  promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get  even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other  men.    http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/sex_partners/content_sex.html     as for gay men: there is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme  promiscuity among gay men. you can read about it in randy schiltz's and the  band played on. he writes about  bathhouse culture pre-hiv; he also discusses  how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you  might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having  many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. it was an  explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.     that view seems to have died, in more ways than one. part of the point of  schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played  in spreading the aids epidemic that eventually killed schiltz, among so many  others. this doesn't let eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that  there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.  tom

easy_ham,well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop i already got to just run amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just openbsd!  this is a near-term thing i could look forward to!  however, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned.  most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a dell 2650, preferably: 1- geforce4 440 go or newer, pleasingly modern gpu; the    geforce2go (with 16mb video ram; too little) i have is    not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would    actually crash from running too hot and too fast.    (accelerating the ami* and possibly openuae graphics    is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,    but an energy-efficient gpu is a good sideeffect and     portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)  1.5- great control over cpu state; by use of 'internet keys'     wired to bios/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll     wheel.  also, hibernate that works, please.  1.7- bootable to usb 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)     in bios, please.  2- p4 dells overheat.  they have a big heatsink and a little fan    to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off    the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  not good   for mtbs (mean time between service; unless you've got an   angle on making money on service from amigans.....)      one excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs   behind the amlcd, thus using the backside of the display   half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion   below.

easy_ham,gordon mohr: it was clear you were talking about averages. but it should  be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they use the word "promiscuity".   sigh.  this sprung out of a report linked by cindy about the promiscuity of female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically not the tail end of the distribution.  "by mating with as many extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]"   ok, then. consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each pair off with 500,000 women. then, 1 man, let's call him "wilt", also has sex with the other 499,999 women  this has never happened.  its relevance is nil.   averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their  actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.  so i chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this is fork and one tends to assume that people have a clue.   there is no disagreement between us, except that i am more interested in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  actually, you probably just had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.   eot, afaic.  r

easy_ham,this article from nytimes.com  has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.   sure does explain fork :-)  not yet abandoned,   rohit  khare@alumni.caltech.edu   some friends, indeed, do more harm than good  september 10, 2002 by mary duenwald         friends are supposed to be good for you. in recent years, scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress, they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless. they are even less susceptible to the common cold, studies show.   but not all friends have such a salutary effect. some lie, insult and betray. some are overly needy. some give too much advice. psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends.   "friendship is often very painful," said dr. harriet lerner, a psychologist and the author of "the dance of connection." "in a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and i'm disbanding it."   another book, "when friendship hurts," by dr. jan yager, a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. "there's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime," dr. yager said. "but sometimes it's better that they end."   that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all. marriage and family relationships - between siblings or parents and children - have been seen as more important.   of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad.   as a popular author of relationship advice books, dr. lerner said, "never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me."   dr. beverley fehr, a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg, noted that sociological changes, like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health.   "now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for stability the way it was in the past, and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy," said dr. fehr, the author of "friendship processes."   until the past couple of years, the research on friendship focused on its health benefits. "now we're starting to look at it as a more full relationship," said dr. suzanna rose, a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami. "like marriage, friendship also has negative characteristics."   the research is in its infancy. psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship, dr. fehr said. so far they have only, through surveys and interviews, figured out that it is a significant problem. the early research, dr. fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought.   how can a friend be bad? most obviously, dr. rose said, by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised pursuit. "when you think of people who were friends at enron," she added, "you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior."   betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. "when friends split up," said dr. keith e. davis, a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina, "it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."   another form of betrayal, dr. yager said, is when a friend suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. "it's more than just pulling away," she said. "the silent treatment is actually malicious."   at least as devastating is an affair with the friend's romantic partner, as recently happened to one of dr. lerner's patients. "i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out," dr. lerner said.   a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person, dr. yager said. one of the 180 people who responded to dr. yager's most recent survey on friendship described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her "a derogatory name." the woman, now 32, was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since, dr. yager said.   emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse, but it is "more insidious," dr. yager said. "some people constantly set up their friends," she explained. "they'll have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or she finds out."   risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends, dr. yager said, but they are not the only ones. she identifies 21 different varieties. occupying the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends.   most common is the promise breaker. "this includes everyone from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them, but then isn't," dr. yager said.   some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do, when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one.   "with couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there's something important they don't like about the other person," said dr. rose of florida international. "one might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other person is a racist. in friendships, which are less intense, it may take even more time for one person to meet the other's dislike criteria."   whether a friendship is worth saving, dr. lerner said, "depends on how large the injury is."   "sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go," she added. "it's also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person's limitations."   acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses, dr. lerner said, because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one.   but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is to pull away, dr. yager said, to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to get together, ever.   "it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship, but only one to end it," dr. yager said.   friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far easier to dissolve than marriage. but it is also comparatively fragile, experts say. ideally, the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones, dr. lerner said.   "it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you're healthy and your life and work are going well," she said. "because when a crisis hits, when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and life-preserving good friendship is."  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10frie.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977    how to advertise --------------------------------- for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media  kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  for general information about nytimes.com, write to  help@nytimes.com.    copyright 2002 the new york times company

easy_ham,i like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...  http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html  "once the client component is installed, a server can order a program to run on the client. any cgi script, java servlet, asp component, etc. could be run on the client. this is like breaking the web server into two parts. originally, web servers just understood http and sent pages. then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the client do the other razzamatazz. this is superior to javascript in one important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is loaded, as javascript functions do.  and because xdegrees uses web-compatible technology, users can access xdegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their browser."  === "scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system. ceo michael tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources. scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers (xdegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as akamai does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default "home" server. enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house applications."  "files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet, as with napster or freenet. in fact, the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth connections can download portions, or "stripes," of a file from several cached locations simultaneously. the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original. a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an http header for the file."

"the demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies  are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails,  financial documents and transaction records," said mike dooley, senior  director of marketing for the desktop products group at maxtor. "users may  not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but  when they do need access, it must be instant. recent advances in ata  technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our  legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ata  hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these  enterprise applications."  the maxline family includes the 5400-rpm maxline ii, designed for  capacities up to 320 gb and the 7200-rpm maxline plus ii, designed for  capacities up to 250 gb. at these capacities, maxline offers higher storage  density than many tape and optical solutions. these drives have also been  tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements,  already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust maxtor designs,  which exceed mttf of over one million hours. these drives will also carry a  three-year warranty.  the maxline ii and maxline plus ii feature the maxtor fast drivetm  ultraata/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 mb per second.  the maxline ii and maxline plus ii will be available with next-generation  serial ata interface for higher performance. at 150 mb per second maximum  data transfer rate, serial ata improves hard drive performance to keep pace  with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive  environments and enterprise applications.  with a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for  managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ata  advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface.  the interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn  allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with  increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.  "maxtor's maxline family of drives provide a solution for storing data that  has previously been too expensive to keep on disk," said dave reinsel,  analyst at idc. "the ata drives offer a great value, low cost per gb and  when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling  cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have  been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications."  availability limited qualification units of the parallel ata versions of maxtor maxline  ii and maxline plus ii are now available; with volume units available in  the fourth quarter. qualification units of the maxline ii and maxline plus  ii with serial ata will be available later this month with volume shipments  scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.  about maxtor maxtor corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world's leading suppliers  of information storage solutions. the company has an expansive line of  storage products for desktop computers, storage systems, high-performance  servers and consumer electronics. maxtor has a reputation as a proven  market leader built by consistently providing high-quality products and  service and support for its customers. maxtor and its products can be found  at www.maxtor.com or by calling toll-free (800) 2-maxtor. maxtor is traded  on the nyse under the mxo symbol.  note: maxtor, maxline and the maxtor logo are registered trademarks of  maxtor corporation. fast drive is a trademark of maxtor corporation. all  other trademarks are properties of their respective owners.  gb means 1 billion bytes. total accessible capacity varies depending on  operating environment.  this announcement relating to maxtor may contain forward-looking statements  concerning future technology, products incorporating that technology, and  maxtor's execution. these statements are based on current expectations and  are subject to risks and uncertainties which could materially affect the  company's results, including, but not limited to, market demand for hard  disk drives, the company's ability to execute future production ramps and  utilize manufacturing assets efficiently, pricing, competition, and the  significant uncertainty of market acceptance of new products.  these and  other risk factors are contained in documents that the company files with  the sec, including the form 10-k for fiscal 2001 and its recent 10-qs.  copyright   2001, maxtor corporation  . privacy policy.    --  ((udhay shankar n)) ((udhay @ pobox.com)) ((www.digeratus.com))

easy_ham, http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.asp   september 11, 2002 8:00 a.m. the wages of september 11 there is no going back.    september 11 changed our world. those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets.  this is a colossal misjudgment. the collapse of the towers, the crashing into the pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 americans   all seen live in real time by millions the world over   tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds, which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. the killers dealt in icons   the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power, and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world. yes, they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.  islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally repugnant   and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades. by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only ghoulish not fearsome.  the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden, the more it has found them both vile and yet banal   and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for. it is one thing to kill innocents, quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states. easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september 11 will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda, but also the complete repudiation of the taliban, the iranian mullocracy, the plague of the pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist paradise on earth.  foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. our coalition with europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euro-american globetrotters   a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the cold war. the truth is that europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords. this sad realization september 11 brutally exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings. indeed, as the months progressed the problems inherent in "the european way" became all too apparent: pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and constant american ankle-biting even as europe lives in a make-believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders, with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along. nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september 11.  america learned that "moderate" arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations. after september 11, being a saudi, egyptian, or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american   at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan, syrian, or lebanese citizenship. indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases   like nato   belongs to a pre-9/11 age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. now we learn that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles   and as likely to come from friends as enemies. worst-case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long-term hope than "stable regimes" like the saudis; governments that hate us have populations that like us   and vice versa; the saudi royal family, whom 5,000 american troops protect, and the mubarak autocracy, which has snagged billions of american dollars, are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists. and with good reason: islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed.  the post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq "chicken hawks" and worse. yet such traditional vietnam-era invective i think rings hollow after september 11, and sounds more like mcclellan's shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton's audacity in charging after murderous nazis. more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly 30 years ago. indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank god, there is no generation of americans in the present military   other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf, mogadishu, and panama   who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.  real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home. it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high-rises.  politics have been turned upside down. in the old days, cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik. in the age of russian expansionism, they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. thus they were so often at loggerheads with na ve and idealist leftists.  no longer. the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the russians. instead, even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists. the latter, if multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral western construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. the right, not the left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and idealism   with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.  all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september 11 and the subsequent terrible year   and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.      
easy_ham,-----begin pgp signed message----- hash: sha1  say 'amen' somebody. what the wsj said, appended below.   the wtc, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle, expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the "good" of the city, and owned by an "authority" looking for something else to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation.  now, of course, it's about to get worse. the sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government.  as a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be "granted" away  in a potlatch that only government, and special-interest "communities", (or "stakeholders", or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection.   all this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. not religious fanaticism. not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. *commerce*.   if they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called "authority" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.  if the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. they could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event.  and, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. whatever the market will bear.   in these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism.  it's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later.  and, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the world trade center.  cheers, rah  - -------  http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,sb1031705210159756235,00.html   the wall street journal  september 11, 2002 review & outlook  a living memorial  as we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the six-story crater where the twin towers once stood. like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one.  the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions, especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.  but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about. so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the trade center fell. instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. new york's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.  this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. in consultation with new york governor george pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own november re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. the manhattan institute's steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.  a big part of the problem in new york is that the city's anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. they want the world trade center site -- and even some surrounding areas - -- transformed into an enormous park. these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment. worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti-development agenda in the name of "honoring" the dead. one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.  we are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. the great cities of europe and japan, devastated in world war ii, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam, the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.  in this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the revolutionary war, the war of 1812, the civil war, the spanish-american war, world war i, world war ii, korea and southeast asia. no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names.  in new york now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. rudolph giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. governor pataki has called for no structures on the "footprints," which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover.  maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. maybe those responsible for the world trade center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. the best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.  -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5  iqa/awubpx9zd8pxh8jf3ohaeqi2aacgv7mtb5vktprj5mjqt1oyzyifzusan273 fgnkontna6+smlo8tb4xybc2 =09az -----end pgp signature-----  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'   
easy_ham, http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml  dear garrison,  there are at least six plans about what to do with "ground zero" in new york. i believe a suitable memorial surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways, children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives. what do you think should done with the space?  joe adams hillsdale, new jersey  i dread the thought of a big memorial in manhattan that's designed by committee and that's gone through public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more public space that the public hates, of which there are plenty already. new york is a bustling commercial city and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the towers, and it's not a memorializing city. historic events occurred in new york that in any other city would be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and historical museums and in new york there's barely a little plaque. that's a great thing, in my estimation. it's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for their big chance, and compared to that spirit of entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a statue of something seems dead to me. look at grant's tomb. who walks past it and thinks about president grant? nobody. people sit in the plaza by grant's tomb and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all the things that new york is about. if you want to find grant, read his memoirs. his monument seems odd in new york: it belongs in washington, which is our memorial city. new york is for the young and lively.

easy_ham, "60 minutes ii" bush interview:  (cbs) no president since abraham lincoln has seen such horrific loss of  life in a war on american soil. no president since james madison, nearly  200 years ago, has seen the nation s capital city successfully attacked.  but, one year ago, president george w. bush was thrown into the first  great crisis of the 21st century.  this is the president s story of september 11th and the week america  went to war. 60 minutes ii spent two hours with mr. bush, one, on air  force one and another in the oval office last week. even after a year,  the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he  remembers sept. 11.   i knew, the farther we get away from sept.11, the more likely it is for  some around the world to forget the mission, but not me,  mr. bush says  during the air force one interview.  not me. i made the pledge to myself  and to people that i m not going to forget what happened on sept. 11. so  long as i m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to  justice. we owe that to those who have lost their lives.   the memories come back sharp and clear on air force one, where pelley  joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 minutes ii  wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first  hours after the attack.  not since lyndon johnson was sworn in on air force one has the airplane  been so central to america in a crisis.  for president bush, sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine.  before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. it was just before  6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: mohammad  atta. two hours later, as mr. bush drove to an elementary school,  hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the  airliners east. as the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet  engines echoed in manhattan.  atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into world trade center tower one.   i thought it was an accident,  says mr. bush.  i thought it was a pilot  error. i thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a  terrible mistake.   mr. bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a  class of second graders. he was watching a reading drill when, just  after nine, united flight 175 exploded into the second tower. there was  the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was  a coordinated attack.  back in the florida classroom, press secretary ari fleischer got the  news on his pager. the president s chief-of-staff, andy card stepped in.   a second plane hit the second tower; america is under attack,  card  told the president  when he said those words, what did he see in the president s face?   i saw him coming to recognition of what i had said,  card recalls.  i  think he understood that he was going to have to take command as  commander-in-chief, not just as president.   what was going through bush s mind when he heard the news?   we re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we re going to do  something about it,  mr. bush recalls.  i realized i was in a unique  setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and i was  looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. i  can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to  get the calls and seeing the look on their face. and it became evident  that we were, you know, that the world had changed.   mr. bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. he called  the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the  attack on tv. then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first  words to the nation.  "ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for america,  he said  in the speech.  today, we ve had a national tragedy.   it was 9:30 a.m. as he spoke, mr. bush didn t know that two more  hijacked jets were streaking toward washington. vice pesident dick  cheney was in his office at the white house when a secret service agent  ran in.   he said to me,  sir, we have to leave immediately  and grabbed, put a  hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the  door of my office,  cheney recalls.  i m not sure how they do it, but  they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.    there wasn t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice  president,  says secret service director brian stafford, who was in his  command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the first  family. he felt that he had only minutes to work with.  we knew there  were unidentified planes tracking in our direction,  he says.  cheney was rushed deep under the white house into a bunker called the  presidential emergency operations center. it was built for war, and this  was it. on her way down, national security advisor condoleezza rice  called mr. bush.   it was brief because i was being pushed to get off the phone and get  out of the west wing,  says rice.  they were hurrying me off the phone  with the president and i just said, he said,  i m coming back  and we  said  mr. president that may not be wise.  i remember stopping briefly  to call my family, my aunt and uncle in alabama and say,  i m fine. you  have to tell everybody that i m fine  but then settling into trying to  deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, i  think the thing that was on everybody s mind was how many more planes  are coming.   the capitol was evacuated. and for the first time ever, the secret  service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of  succession. agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become  president if the others were killed. they wanted to move vice president  cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. but cheney says  when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the  white house, no matter what.   it s important to emphasize it's not personal, you don t think of it in  personal terms, you ve got a professional job to do,  says cheney.  cheney was joined by transportation secretary norm mineta who remembers  hearing the faa counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the  capital.  says mineta:  someone came in and said  mr. vice president there s a  plane 50 miles out,  then he came in and said  its now 10 miles out, we  don t know where it is exactly, but it s coming in low and fast.    it was american flight 77. at 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the pentagon,  the first successful attack on washington since the war of 1812.  as the pentagon burned, mr. bush s limousine sped toward air force one  in florida. at that moment, united flight 93 - the last hijacked plane -  was taking dead aim at washington. at the white house, the staff was in  the west wing cafeteria, watching on tv. press secretary jennifer  millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.   i no sooner walked outside when someone from the secret service yelled   women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,  and suddenly  the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and  the whole white house just flooded out,  she recalls.  in florida, as mr. bush boarded air force one, he was overheard telling  a secret service agent  be sure to get the first lady and my daughters  protected.  at 9:57 a.m., air force one thundered down the runway,  blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. communications  director dan bartlett was on board.   it was like a rocket,  he remembers.  for a good ten minutes, the plane  was going almost straight up.   at the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, world trade center  tower two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche  of steel, concrete and human lives.   someone said to me,  look at that  i remember that,  look at that  and  i looked up and i saw and i just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and  the horror of that moment,  recalls rice of the tv newscast.  she also felt something in her gut:  that we ve lost a lot of americans  and that eventually we would get these people. i felt the anger. of  course i felt the anger.   down in the bunker, cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked  planes there were. officials feared there could be as many as 11.  as the planes track toward washington, a discussion begins about whether  to shoot them down.  i discussed it with the president,  cheney  recalls.   are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these  airliners that have been hijacked?  he said yes.    it was my advice. it was his decision,  says cheney.   that s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot  down your own civilian aircraft,  says bush.  but it was an easy  decision to make given the   given the fact that we had learned that a  commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. i say easy decision, it  was, i didn t hesitate, let me put it that way. i knew what had to be  done.   the passengers on united flight 93 also knew what had to be done. they  fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a pennsylvania meadow.  the flight was 15 minutes from washington.   clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of  government as they could: the pentagon, perhaps the capitol, perhaps the  white house. these people saved us not only physically but they saved us  psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,  says  rice.  meanwhile, tower one was weakening. it had stood for an hour and 43  minutes. at 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of  its twin.  the image that went round the world reached the first lady in a secure  location somewhere in washington.  i was horrified,  she says.  i  thought,  dear god, protect as many citizens as you can.  it was a  nightmare.   by 10:30 a.m., america s largest city was devastated, its military  headquarters were burning. air force one turned west along the gulf  coast.   i can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the  consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining  moment in the history of the united states,  says president bush.  i  didn t need any legal briefs, i didn t need any consultations, i knew we  were at war.   mr. bush says the first hours were frustrating. he watched the  horrifying pictures, but the tv signal was breaking up. his calls to  cheney were cutting out. mr. bush says he pounded his desk shouting,   this is inexcusable; get me the vice president.    i was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says  the president. "information was just flying from all directions.   chief of staff card brought in the reports. there was word camp david  had been hit. a jet was thought to be targeting mr. bush s ranch.   i remember hearing that the state department might have been hit, or  that the white house had a fire in it. so we were hearing lots of  different information,  says card.  they also feared that air force one itself was a target. cheney told the  president there was a credible threat against the plane. using the code  name for air force one, mr. bush told an aide,  angel is next.  the  threat was passed to presidential pilot colonel mark tillman.   it was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get  the president home,  tillman says.  we actually have to consider  everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to  make sure that no one knows what our position is.   tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while secret  service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. the  crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. then came a warning from  air traffic control   a suspect airliner was dead ahead.   coming out of sarasota there was one call that said there was an  airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,  tillman  remembers.  tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal  traffic. they were on course for washington, but by now no one thought  that was a good idea, except the president.   i wanted to come back to washington, but the circumstances were such  that it was just impossible for the secret service or the national  security team to clear the way for air force one to come back,  says  bush.  so air force one set course for an underground command center in  nebraska. back in washington, the president s closest advisor, karen  hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to mr.  bush.   and the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me,  sounded very shaken said,  ma am, i m sorry, we can t reach air force  one.   hughes recalls. hughes was out of the white house during the  attacks. when she came back, it was a place she didn t recognize.   there were either military, or maybe secret service, dressed all in  black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. and i never expected to  see something like that in, in our nation's capital,  says hughes.  when she walked into the white house, no one was inside.  i knew it was  a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so i yelled,   hello?  and two, again, kind of swat team members came running, running  through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to  the location where i met the vice president.   on air force one, col. tillman had a problem. he needed to hide the most  visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the white house itself. he  didn t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening  to air traffic control. so he called air traffic control on the  telephone.   we actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were  heading,  says tillman.  we, we basically just talked to 'em and said,  'ok, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly  across the united states.'   controllers passed air force one from one sector to another, warning  each other to keep the route secret.   ok, where s he going?  one tower radioed to another.   just watch him,  a second tower responded.  don t question him where s  he's going. just work him and watch him, there s no flight plan in and  we re not going to put anything in. ok, sir?   air force one ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed  back:  air force one, got two f-16s at about your 10 o clock position.    the staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside  hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,   says bartlett.  and the president gives them a signal of salute, and the  pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.   the men in the f-16s were shane brotherton and randy roberts, from the  texas air national guard. their mission was so secret their commander  wouldn t tell them where they were going.   he just said, 'you ll know when you see it,' and that was my first  clue, i didn t have any idea what we were going up until that point,   says brotherton. he knew when he saw it.   we, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around air force  one, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles,  says  roberts.  bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this  aircraft, or for his own safety:  i looked out the airplane and saw two  f-16s on each wing. it was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to  get us.   we now know that the threat to air force one was part of the fog of war,  a false alarm. but it had a powerful effect at the time. some wondered,  with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? he  hadn t appeared after the attack on washington. mr. bush was clearly  worried about it. at one point he was overheard saying,  the american  people want to know where their dang president is.  the staff considered  an address to the nation by phone but instead mr. bush ordered air force  one to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on tv. at  11:45 a.m., they landed at barksdale air force base in louisiana.   the resolve of our great nation is being tested. but make no mistake,  we will show the world that we will pass this test. god bless,  bush  said to the nation from barksdale.  at barksdale, the secret service believed the situation in washington  was still unsafe. so the plane continued on to nebraska, to the command  center where mr. bush would be secure and have all the communications  gear he needed to run the government. aboard air force one, mr. bush had  a job for press secretary fleischer.   the president asked me to make sure that i took down everything that  was said. i think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,  says  fleischer  fleischer s notes capture mr. bush s language, plain and unguarded. to  the vice president he said:  we re at war, dick, we re going to find out  who did this and kick their ass.  another time, mr. bush said,  we re  not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.   the president adds,  i can remember telling the secretary of defense, i  said,  we re going to find out who did this and then mr. secretary, you  and dick myers,  who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs,  are  going to go get them.    by 3 p.m., air force one touched down at offutt air force base in  nebraska. mr. bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that  gave no hint of what they would find below.  at the bottom of the stairs was the u.s. strategic command underground  command center. it was built to transmit a president s order to go to  nuclear war. but when mr. bush walked in, the battle staff was watching  the skies over the united states. many airplanes had still not landed.  after a short briefing, mr. bush and card were taken to a teleconference  center which connected them to the white house, the pentagon, the fbi  and the cia. mr. bush had a question for his cia director george tenent.  according to rice, bush asked tenent who had done this. rice recalls  that tenent answered:  sir, i believe its al qaeda. we re doing the  assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al qaeda.   the evidence would build. fbi director robert mueller says that an  essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.  a flight attendant on american flight 11, amy sweeney, had the presence  of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the  seat numbers of the hijackers.  that was the first piece of hard  evidence. we could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in  those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those  individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and  going through a process of elimination,  says mueller.  in nebraska, the white house staff was preparing for an address to the  nation from the air force bunker, but by then the president had had  enough. he decided to come back.   at one point, he said he didn t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him  out of washington,  fleischer says.  that verbatim.   on board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world:   i had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. one was that  you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because i knew these terrorists  like al-qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. the  other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition  of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.   as air force one sped east, the last casualty of the attack on america  collapsed, one of the nation s worst days wore into evening. at the  world trade center, 2,801 were killed; at the pentagon, 184; and in  pennsylvania 40. altogether, there were 3,025 dead.   anybody who would attack america the way they did, anybody who would  take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil,   bush said recently.  mr. bush would soon see that evil face to face. after arriving in  washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the pentagon on the  way to the white house.  was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a white  house to return to?  i don t remember thinking about whether or not the  white house would have been obliterated," he recalls. "i think i might  have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to  take our best shot.   mr. bush arrived back at the white house nine hours after the attacks.  his next step was an address to the nation. karen hughes and her staff  were already working on the speech.   he decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was  reassurance,  remembers hughes.  we had to show resolve, we had to  reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be ok.   just off the oval office, mr. bush added the words that would become  known as the bush doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those  who harbor them. the staff wanted to add a declaration of war but mr.  bush didn t think the american people wanted to hear it that night and  he was emphatic about that.  he prepared to say it from the same desk where franklin roosevelt first  heard the news of pearl harbor. now bush was commander in chief. eighty  million americans were watching.   today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under  attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,  he said  from the oval office that night.  the oval office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in american  history since the civil war. before he walked to the white house  residence for the night, mr. bush dictated these words for the white  house daily log:  the pearl harbor of the 21st century took place today.  we think it's osama bin laden.   (cbs) when sept. 12 dawned, president bush was demanding a war plan. no  one in the white house or the pentagon could be sure of what the  president would do. in office for just eight months, he d never been  tested as commander-in-chief.   i never asked them what they thought,  president bush said of the  pentagon brass,  because i didn t really   because i knew what i was  gonna do. i knew exactly what had to be done, scott. and that was to set  a strategy to seek justice. find out who did it, hunt them down and  bring them to justice.   in the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next:  the  deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against  our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,  he  said.  to the war cabinet, al qaeda was no surprise. national security advisor  condoleezza rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to  strike bin laden s organization well before sept. 11.   the president said,  you know i m tired of swatting at flies, i need a  strategy to eliminate these guys,   rice recalls.  in one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the cia and fbi didn t  pick up clues that an attack in the united states was imminent. without  a sense of urgency, the white house strategy the president had asked for  came too late.  chief of staff andrew card recalls that the plan mr. bush had asked for  was  literally headed to the president s desk, i think, on the eleventh,  tenth or eleventh, of september.   on sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options -  who to hit and how to hit them. there were some at the pentagon who  worried in the early hours that mr. bush would order up an immediate  cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin laden in  the past.   well, there s a lot of nervous nellies at the pentagon, anyway,  mr.  bush tells pelley.  a lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than  they should. but no, i appreciate that very much. secretary of defense  (donald) rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what  we called  boots on the ground.  that if you re gonna go to war, then  you ve gotta go to war with all your assets.   the president says he wanted to  fight and win a guerilla war with  conventional means.   it was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by cia director  george tenent. tenent wanted to combine american technology and  intelligence with the brute force of afghan fighters hostile to the  taliban government.  secretary of state colin powell, noting that the cia had already  developed a long relationship with the afghan resistance, called it an  unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.   as i like to describe it to my friends,  powell says,  we had on the  ground a fourth world army riding horses and living in tents with some  cia and special forces with them and we had a first world air force, the  best in the world. how do you connect it all?   the president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.  meanwhile, mr. bush went to the battlefield himself. just the day  before, he had called the pentagon the  mightiest building in the  world.  now one-fifth of it was in ruins. the wreckage of american  flight 77 was being examined by navy investigators. and before mr. bush  left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering  the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch. the next day, sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the  public never heard about. threats had been were coming in constantly but  this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the white house.  the secret service wanted the president back in the bunker.   he wasn t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,  remembers  brian stafford, director of the secret service.  and he ordered a  hamburger and said he was going to stay in the white house that evening  and that s what he did.   the next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the  president. on friday, sept. 14, mr. bush started the day with a cabinet  meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.   he sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,   says powell who remembers being worried that the president might have  trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service  later that morning.   and i just scribbled a little note to him,  powell recalls,  and i  said,  mr. president, i ve learned over the years when you are going to  give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will  cause you to start to tear up.  he looked at me and he smiled and then  at the next break in the conversation he said,  the secretary of state  told me not to break down at the memorial service,  and that broke the  tension and everybody started laughing and i felt embarrassed.   first lady laura bush was involved in planning the memorial service and  she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting.  i wanted  the psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because i think  we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.   it also stirred the mourners  resolve, as rice remember.  as we stood to  sing the battle hymn of the republic,  she says,  you could feel the  entire congregation and i could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind  of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.   we all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had  been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what  had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually  going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.   next came a visit to ground zero. the president was not prepared for  what he encountered there.   you couldn t brief me, you couldn t brief anybody on ground zero until  you saw it," mr. bush says.  it was like   it was ghostly. like you re  having a bad dream and you re walking through the dream.   the president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men  and women at ground zero began to chant,  usa! usa!.    there was a lot of bloodlust,  the president recalls.  people were, you  know, pointing their big old hands at me saying,  don t you ever forget  this, mr. president. don t let us down.  the scene was very powerful.  very powerful.   when mr. bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting,  we can t hear  you.   the president responded,  i can hear you. i can hear you. the rest of  the world hears you. and the people who knocked these buildings down  will hear all of us soon.   mr. bush had been in new york just a few weeks before; he d posed with  the firemen who always stood by whenever the president s helicopter  landed there. now, five of the men who stood with the president in the  picture were dead   lost at ground zero.  when the president arrived sept. 14, manhattan was papered with the  faces of the lost. families, unable to believe that so many had vanished  in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just  missing. it was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.  at a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several  hundred of these families in a convention hall.   people said to me,  he ll come out. don t worry, mr. president, we ll  see him soon. i know my loved one, he will - he ll find a place to  survive underneath the rubble and we ll get him out.  i, on the other  hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and  cry, but i remember the whole time thinking,  this is incredibly sad  because the loved ones won t come out.    one little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his  firefighter uniform and as he signed it, mr. bush remembers, he told the  boy,  your daddy won t believe that i was here, so you show him that  autograph.   it was an effort  to provide a little hope,  the president recalls.  i  still get emotional thinking about it because we re dealing with people  who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their wives who loved  their husbands. it was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for  all of us because we were a very emotional, and i was emotional at  times. i felt, i felt the same now as i did then, which is sad. and i  still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my  tears, i see opportunity.   the president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes;  he stayed for two and a half hours. it was there he met arlene howard.  the body of her son, george, was among the first to be found at ground  zero.   i called the police department,  howard remembers,   and they said he  hadn t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and i said,   no, i don t need to call back.  if he hadn t called in, i knew where he  was.   george howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993  when the world trade center was bombed. he had been off duty that day,  and he was off duty on sept. 11, but couldn t stay away. the police  department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.   he (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,  howard recalls.  and  he extends his sympathy to me and that s when i asked him i d like to  present george s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who  were killed over there.   by the end of that day, mr. bush flew to camp david visibly drained.   he was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was  emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,  recalls card..  the next day   saturday, sept. 15 - mr. bush met members of his war  cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.   my message is for everybody who wears the uniform   get ready. the  united states will do what it takes,  mr. bush told them.  as powell remembers it,  he was encouraging us to think boldly. he was  listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he  wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.   president bush was pleased with the progress that had been made.  on the  other hand,  he says,  i wanted to clarify plans and i went around the  room and i asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.   when he left that meeting on saturday night, he still had not told the  cabinet what he was planning.   i wanted to just think it through,  mr. bush remembers.  any time you  commit troops to harm s way, a president must make sure that he fully  understands all the consequences and ramifications. and i wanted to just  spend some time on it alone. and did.   what were his reservations?  mr. bush says,  could we win? i didn t want to be putting our troops in  there unless i was certain we could win. and i was certain we could win.   nine days after the attacks on america, before a joint session of  congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.   each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it  happened,  mr. bush told the congress and the nation.  we ll remember  the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. some  will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. some will carry  memories of a face and a voice gone forever. and i will carry this. it  is the police shield of a man named george howard, who died at the world  trade center trying to save others. it was given to me by his mom,  arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. it is my reminder of lives that  ended and a task that does not end.   a year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to  remind americans of what happened and of the war that is still being  waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the oval office,  literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.  in his desk, the president says,  i have a classified document that  might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about who s  out there, where they might be   and as the terrorists are captures or killed?  i might make a little  check there, yeah,  mr. bush admits.  but there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list    osama bin laden.  (cbs) a lot has happened in the year since sept. 11. one year ago, the  president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy.  he had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. now,  on his orders, u.s. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did  not expect, in a world completely changed. in the oval office last week,  cbs news correspondent scott pelley asked the president about iraq,  about whether americans are safe at home and about osama bin laden. ------------------------------------------------------------------------   scott pelley: you must be frustrated, maybe angry. after a year, we  still don t have osama bin laden?  president bush: how do you know that? i don t know whether osama bin  laden is dead or alive. i don t know that. he s not leading a lot of  parades. and he s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he  was. this is much bigger than one person anyway. this is   we re slowly  but surely dismantling and disrupting the al qaeda network that, that  hates america. and we will stay on task until we complete the task. i  always knew this was a different kind of war, scott. see, in the old  days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his  tanks or his airplanes and his ships. this is an international manhunt.  we re after these people one at the time. they re killers. period.  pelley: but have you won the war before you find osama bin laden dead or  alive?  mr. bush: if he were dead, there s somebody else to replace him. and we  would find that person. but slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al  qaeda network. and those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. and  at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary  so that people don t feel like they ve got to conduct terror to achieve  objectives.  pelley: do you look back on the afghan campaign with any doubts?  certainly, we ve overthrown the taliban government. certainly, al qaeda  has been scattered. but some of the taliban leaders appear to have  gotten away. and there have been many civilian casualties as well.  mr. bush: uh huh. well, you know, i am sad that civilians lost their  life. but i understand war. we did everything we can to   everything we  could to protect people. when civilians did die, it was because of a  mistake. certainly not because of intention. we liberated a country for  which i m extremely proud. no,   i don t second guess things. it s    things never go perfect in a time of war.  pelley: are you committed to ending the rule of saddam hussein?  mr. bush: i m committed to regime change.  pelley: there are those who have been vocal in their advice against war  in iraq. some of our allies in the gulf war, saudi arabia, turkey for  example. even your father s former national security advisor, mr.  scowcroft has written about it in the paper. what is it in your  estimation that they don t understand about the iraq question that you  do appreciate?  mr. bush: the policy of the government is regime change, scott, hasn t  changed. i get all kinds of advice. i m listening to the advice. i  appreciate the consultations. and we ll consult with a lot of people but  our policy hasn t changed.  pelley: on air force one you described the terrorists as evil.  mr. bush: yeah.  pelley: i don t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same  time, many in the arab world are angry at the united states for  political reasons because of our policy in israel or our troops in the  oil region of the middle east. is there any change in foreign policy  that you re considering that might reduce arab anger against the united  states.  mr. bush: hmm. well, i m working for peace in the middle east. i m the  first president that ever went to the united nations and publicly  declared the need to have a palestinian state living side-by-side with  israel in peace. i ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace  the palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror  and believes in peaces and quits using the palestinian people as pawns.  i've also made it clear to the other arab nations in the region that  they ve got responsibilities. if you want peace they gotta work toward  it. we re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it  as well. but all this business isn t going to happen as long as a few  are willing to blow up the hopes of many. so we all gotta work to fight  off terror.  pelley: arafat has to go?  mr. bush: either, he s, he s been a complete failure as far as i am  concerned. utter disappointment.  pelley: there has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.  mr. bush: yeah   pelley: in fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your  administration s decision to close certain deportation hearings. they  said, quote,  a government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to  the constitution.  where do you draw the line sir?  mr. bush: i draw the line at the constitution. we will protect america.  but we will do so on, within the guidelines of the constitution,  confines of the constitution, spirit of the constitution.  pelley: is there anything that the justice department has brought to you  as an idea that you ve thought,  no, that s too far. i don t wanna go "  mr. bush: nah, not that that i remember. and i am pleased with the  justice department. i think that attorney general s doing a fine job, by  the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure  that they review decisions we make, i think that s fine. i mean, that s  good. it s healthy. it s part of america.  pelley: franklin roosevelt said that america should stand in defense of  four freedoms. freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want  and freedom from fear. do we have that today mr. president? freedom from  fear?  mr. bush: i think more than we did, in retrospect. the fact that we are  on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us  more free from fear than on that fateful day of september the 11th.  we ve got more work to do.  pelley: and americans should not live their lives in fear?  mr. bush: i don t think so. no. i think americans oughta know their  government s doing everything possible to help. and obviously if we get  information that relates directly a particular attack we ll deal with  it. and if we get noise that deals with a general attack, we ll alert  people. there are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny  and run down leads. and the american people need to go about their  lives. it seems like they are.

easy_ham,i am delurking to comment on the salon article. i just wanted to say that i am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. i sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. if i had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. however, i watch the frontline show "faith and doubt at ground zero" on pbs. that show tackled head on, with much more courage than i have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (karlheinz stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers. i am not a religious person but i stunned at the scope of this program. it talked about the lutheran minister who spoke at yankees stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the lutherans have the one true path?). thanks for listening, i just felt like i needed to put the word out about this program. my shallow comment on salon and others like it (my boyfriend and i had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about howsomeof ustend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others. mike chris haun wrote: i though this was all rather interesting, first bit of 9/11 coverage that i've liked.http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/09/11/forbidden_letters/index.htmlchrisdo you yahoo!? yahoo! news - today's headlines
easy_ham,  when we were discussing kuhn, i wrote:    my understanding of the history of  plate tectonics is that the magnetic  reversal patterns encoded in seafloor  basalts were crucial supporting data  which suddenly became available only  after navy declassification, so the  adoption curve may be skewed.  many of the essays in oreskes' _plate tectonics_ seem to support this idea:  sandwell, "plate tectonics: a martian view"  in this essay, i'll describe a few of the important confirmations of  plate tectonic theory provided by satellites and ships.  these tools  were largely developed to support the cold war effort, and many are  labeled geodetic since they are used to make precise measurements  of the size and shape of the earth and the spatial variations in the  pull of gravity.  the tools of satellite geodesy are needed for all  aspects of global warfare; precise satellite tracking and gravity  field development are needed for precision satellite surveillance  as well as for targeting ballistic missiles; the global positioning  system is used in all aspects of modern warfare; radar altimetery is  used or aiming submarine-launched ballistic missiles as well as for  inertial navigation when submerged.    the global seismic networks were developed, primarily, to monitor  underground nuclear tests.  marine magnetometers were developed,  primarily, for detection of submarines.  multibeam sea floor mapping  systems were developed, primarily, for surveying critical and  operational areas of the northern oceans.  ... and the navy was in no hurry to declassify any of these data, as any uneven coverage could have revealed the parts of the oceans they found most interesting.  -dave  (what do our seismic networks say about the middle east?  i hazily recall a story about la reporters asking their local geophysicists about an early morning quake, to be told that, as far as could be figured, the "epicenter" was at a negative depth, travelling near mach speed, and presumably headed towards edwards)

easy_ham,an old indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentid=a58173-2002mar7&notfound=true  slaughter in the name of god by salman rushdie friday, march 8, 2002; page a33 washington post  the defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and  blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the  remains of a human bonfire in ahmadabad, gujarat, in india. the murder  of children is something of an indian specialty. the routine daily  killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in  nellie, assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring  village . . . the massacre of sikh children in delhi during the  horrifying reprisal murders that followed indira gandhi's assassination:  they bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in  evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in  kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or  smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length  of wood.  i say "our" because i write as an indian man, born and bred, who loves  india deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is  potentially capable of doing tomorrow. if i take pride in india's  strengths, then india's sins must be mine as well. do i sound angry?  good. ashamed and disgusted? i certainly hope so. because, as india  undergoes its worst bout of hindu-muslim bloodletting in more than a  decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed  or disgusted enough. police chiefs have been excusing their men's  unwillingness to defend the citizens of india, without regard to  religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to  the same sentiments as the nation in general.  meanwhile, india's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering  the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control.  (it has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the bharatiya  janata party (bjp), or indian people's party, and the hindu extremists  of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), or world hindu council, are sister  organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) even some  international commentators, such as britain's independent newspaper,  urge us to "beware excess pessimism."  the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that we're used  to it. it happens every so often; then it dies down. that's how life is,  folks. most of the time india is the world's largest secular democracy;  and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we  mustn't let that distort the picture.  of course, there are political explanations. ever since december 1992,  when a vhp mob demolished a 400-year-old muslim mosque in ayodhya, which  they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram, hindu  fanatics have been looking for this fight. the pity of it is that some  muslims were ready to give it to them. their murderous attack on the  train-load of vhp activists at godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes  of the killings of hindus and muslims by the train-load during the  partition riots of 1947) played right into the hindu extremists' hands.  the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and  insufficient radicalism of india's bjp government. prime minister atal  bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a  coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjp's  more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together.  but it isn't working anymore. in state elections across the country, the  bjp is being trounced. this may have been the last straw for the vhp  firebrands. why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic  agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?  the electoral failure of the bjp is thus, in all probability, the spark  that lit the fire. the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the  site of the demolished ayodhya mosque -- that's where the godhra dead  were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically,  tragically, muslims in india equally determined to resist them. vajpayee  has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and  wrongs of the ayodhya issue. the vhp is no longer prepared to wait.  the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi, in a letter to india's  president, k. r. narayanan, blames the gujarat government (led by a bjp  hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing "too little too  late." she pins the blame firmly on the "motivated, well-planned out and  provocative actions" of the hindu nationalists. but another writer, the  nobel laureate v. s. naipaul, speaking in india just a week before the  violence erupted, denounced india's muslims en masse and praised the  nationalist movement.  the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced, and mahasveta devi in  her letter demands "stern legal action" against them. but the vhp is  determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such  public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting  them, naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces  the nobel award.  the political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. but there's  something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face:  namely, that in india, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is  the poison in the blood. where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no  excuse. yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in  the fashionable language of "respect." what is there to respect in any  of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around  the world in religion's dreaded name? how well, with what fatal results,  religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! and  when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results  makes it easier to do it again.  so india's problem turns out to be the world's problem. what happened in  india has happened in god's name. the problem's name is god.  salman rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay  collection "step across this line."    2002 the washington post company   sdw  --  sdw@lig.net http://sdw.st stephen d. williams 43392 wayside cir,ashburn,va 20147-4622 703-724-0118w 703-995-0407fax dec2001

easy_ham,first, it was my understanding that they had the food before they refused to pay.  i often have the goods in my possession before i settle the paycheck.  second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in india.  it isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so i'll have to watch them starve.  the margin of survival is very, very, thin.  so yes.  in my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a little food' in india is akin to a direct act of violence intended to cause suffering if not death on the victims family.  that such an act triggers a violent response is, imho, hardly surprising.  in other words, as far as i could tell the people on the train fired the first shot.  with all of that said i still don't know if this happened or not.  nor do i know for sure that the margin of survival for those muslim vendors was that thin.    -----original message-----  from: stephen d. williams [mailto:swilliams@hpti.com]  sent: monday, september 16, 2002 11:54 am  to: johnhall@evergo.net  cc: fork@example.com; lea@lig.net  subject: re: slaughter in the name of god    wow!  it seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion  field.    if the activists on the train refused to pay for food, then the vendors  shouldn't give it to them.  and the local police force should be  arresting them.  etc.    you have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view,  which obviously was in operation with the participants here, to think  that religious differences or not being paid for a little food (or  taunting!) was even a remote justification for burning a train full of  people alive.    sdw    john hall wrote:   what i understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for   the food and other items they acquired from the muslim vendors -- then   taunted them.     that may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting   light.  taking food from a small vendor in india and not paying them is   trying to starve them.     it sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of   activists.     i'm rarely an apologist for muslims anywhere.  yet i find my sympathies   with the muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.        from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of  stephen d. williams      the pity of it is that some  muslims were ready to give it to them. their murderous attack on the  train-load of vhp activists at godhra (with its awful, atavistic     echoes    of the killings of hindus and muslims by the train-load during the  partition riots of 1947) played right into the hindu extremists'     hands.    sdw  --  swilliams@hpti.com http://www.hpti.com  stephen d. williams, senior technical director

"in these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge," says bernard hulme, chairman and ceo of endeavors technology. "embedding rsa security encryption software into magi products provides it managers with added assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric peer-to-peer computing"  endeavors technology joins the rsa secured  partner program. the program is designed to ensure complete interoperability between partner products and rsa security's solutions including rsa securid  two-factor authentication, rsa cleartrust  web access management, rsa bsafe  encryption and rsa keon  digital certificate management.  the strategic partnership paves the way for magi enterprise to bear the rsa secured brand on product packaging and advertising, be listed in rsa secured partner solutions directories, and have rsa security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability. it will also lead to joint marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide business continuity support.  "endeavors technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise products and streamlining the deployment process for it managers," says stuart cohen, director of partner development at rsa security. "by combining our products, enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."  about magi magi enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration network. for the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc virtual private networks for collaboration very rapidly and affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. magi enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming unsecured, "read-only" web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through the use of such features as cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name spaces generating "follow me urls" for mobile professionals.  about rsa security, inc. rsa security inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations for e-business through its rsa securid two-factor authentication, rsa cleartrust web access management, rsa bsafe encryption and rsa keon digital certificate management product families. with approximately one billion rsa bsafe-enabled applications in use worldwide, more than ten million rsa securid authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, rsa security has the proven leadership and innovative technology to address the changing security needs of e-business and bring trust to the online economy. rsa security can be reached at www.rsasecurity.com.  about endeavors technology, inc. endeavors technology, inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing and network infrastructure vendor tadpole technology plc (www.tadpole.com), which has plants and offices in irvine and carlsbad (california), and cambridge, edinburgh, and bristol (uk). for further information on endeavors' p2p solutions, call 949-833-2800, email to p2p@endeavors.com, or visit the company's website www.endeavors.com.    copyright 2002 endeavors technology, inc. magi, and magi enterprise are registered trademarks of endeavors technology, inc. rsa, bsafe, cleartrust, keon, securid, rsa secured and the most trusted name in e-security are registered trademarks or trademarks of rsa security inc. in the united states and/or other countries. all other products and services mentioned are trademarks of their respective companies.                  2002 endeavors technology, inc., 19600 fairchild, suite 350, irvine, ca 92612, phone 949-833-2800, fax 949-833-2881, email info@endeavors.com.                            all rights reserved; specifications and descriptions subject to change without notice.

easy_ham,   all else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the  square root of air density. air density drops off pretty quickly, and i   really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. i  think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of  the atmosphere trails off.  chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus:  suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity, resulting in the potential energy for a mass m to be linear in height h: mgh.  what relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium?  if they are at the same height, we will have half the mass in one, and half the mass in the other, and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction.[0]  if they are at differing heights, then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends.  in order for the two flows to balance, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower, and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly:      high percentage of thin air     ---------------------------     low percentage of dense air  now, rates are exponential in energy differences[1], so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height, to compensate.  how does it go in practice?  -dave  [0] how well does it balance?     chemical equilibria seem      stable, as they deal with     very large numbers over a     very long time.  economic     equilibria are viewed from     the mayfly standpoint of     individual people, and so,     at best, the shot noise is     very visible.  [1] that is to say, rates will     be exponential in the free     energy differences between     endpoints and a transition     state.  we can ignore that     complication in this model.

(and if there were people would lie and game the system.) it's too easy to say "oh, no!  he's a geek!"   or "she's a cat person,  ick!" when you might have a great time together.  we are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as  people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on  tasks and recreation.   this is all entirely speculative based on nothing  but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the  person's company.   which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of  exposure shrinks after school.  personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to  work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it  doesn't.   i have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the  same poor results.    i have to think it's not the people, but the tool.  an aside (okay, yes, i'm a tool geek):  speed dating speed dating (aka 7 minute dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in  the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   i think  it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a  project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever. it was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young  people to avoid total assimilation.   it has too much "interview" context  and no shared activity beyond that.   i give it several points for effort  though.   i guess my impression that even the speed dating thing doesn't do much for  you means that the traditional advice of "join activities groups" is  actually sound.  eirikur             
easy_ham,gordon mohr quoted: # french writer tried as anti-islam, protest erupts # by caroline brothers # # paris (reuters) - provocative french novelist michel houellebecq # faced a paris court on tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred # by calling islam "the stupidest religion" and its holy book the # koran a depressing read. # # the case, brought against him by four muslim groups, is a cause # celebre reminiscent of the salman rushdie affair, pitting freedom of # expression against religious sensitivities.  very reminiscent indeed.  ayatollah chirac has decreed a death sentence on houellebecq and liked-minded fundamentalists have offered millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding under police protection for a few years.  or maybe some handful of muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to court under "hate speech" laws make a point about people not showin' dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.  or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.   btw i read houellebecq's "extension du domaine de la lutte" recently, about a depressed computer services dude working in paris, looking for love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for nutcases...  yikes!  purposely provocative, very depressing, with some unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted inline in full for pages on end.  it starts out:  "on friday evening, i was invited to a party with some colleagues from work.  there were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from twenty-five to forty.  at one point, some cunt started getting undressed. she took off her t-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all the while making unbelievable faces.  she pranced around for a few seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't know what else to do.  anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  which underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.  after my fourth glass of vodka i started to feel pretty bad so i had to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  shortly after that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  those girls are not pretty at all, the two fat office cows actually.  they go to eat together and read books about the development of language in children, all that sort of stuff."  ... and it's downhill from there!   r

easy_ham,-----begin pgp signed message----- hash: sha1  i know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but i'd suggest, um, church. :-). like woody allen said, 90% of life is showing up, right?   almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust out laughing, and you're set. i, for instance, am a unitarian, which, as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course. (obuujokes: mid 70's bumper-sticker: "honk if you're not sure"; lenny bruce: "did you hear about how the klan burned a question mark on the unitarian's lawn?"; "unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself."; "unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'"; etc...)  but, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (i'm, um, lapsed, on several fronts, a dutch-reformed-turned-atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern baptist of some stripe or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital-republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist bit...), and i still go pretty regularly, though not as much as i used to. heck, the older i get the less of the divine i believe in. i'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and i show up at least once a month. nice folks though, when i can keep a civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when i can't and end up arguing with them. :-).   anyway, if *i* can end up hitched, anyone can. talk about orthogonal. i met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one year after i started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married her 2 years after that, and i wasn't even trying meet women. i was just looking to make friends as i was new in town.   the trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. i mean, some guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. you can practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a room...  that's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. most regular attendants are women. hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in protestant denominations, at least, are women. no matter your age, looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women. you'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at least better looking than you are. :-). the only place where there are *more* women running things is in grass-roots republican politics - -- but i won't go there, i promise.   if i may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, i figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's religions, and the ubiquity of indians in various stages of assimilation in so/nocal, you can find some place to hang out near you, rohit. you probably don't even have to go, um, native, like i did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming, horrors, a unitarian...  cheers, rah  -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5  iqa/awubpyjcbcpxh8jf3ohaeqi2vwcbb2ukmyii/xwkqvvjfswlmmrhebsamwub jdmfqrnrqed3lmw6v8yutn54 =vq/a -----end pgp signature-----  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'

easy_ham,this is for those that have interacted with d winer  "dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around.  you're supposed to just shut up and take it."  http://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/  ===========  who's the real monster?   it seems good ol' uncle dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him.  it seems ben, kevin and bill are making too strong a case.  so here we dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.  anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their way.  yeah sure dave, whatever you need to believe.  the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general.  each with their own brand of attitude, to be sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward.  how is that being monstrous?  is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's perception of them?  if you haven't already, contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness.    9/18/02; 10:07:38 am - discuss    dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand   it's really quite pitiful.  when normal people don't understand something they usually try learning about it.  they read up, ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it.  this before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools.  what dave does is just the opposite.  posts a link to something he doesn't understand get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it. expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools. sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off. exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context. deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1 his continued diatribes about rss-1.0 and it's use of rdf reveal this to be true.  dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  he'd rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying.  one reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  "it's like that movie the poseidon adventure.  dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  i don't know about you but i'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room. the ship's fucking sinking and i don't want to be following the idiot."  dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around.  you're supposed to just shut up and take it.  after all, why would good ol' uncle dave want to hurt you?  it's all about love, right?  to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted.  and if you dare complain, he savages you.  then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing all the trouble.  we've news for you dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking amongst ourselves about it.  we're routing around you damaging behavoir. that's where we're coming from.  if you have an example of how you've tried to help dave, please drop us an e-mail about it.  we'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  send it along to zaphod@egroups.com    9/12/02; 10:13:11 am - discuss     trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...   the trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.  another developer tries talking to dave and discovers it's fundamentally impossible:  his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job.  in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering "that guy is an idiot..."  the zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  if you've got a similar tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.    9/11/02; 2:17:58 pm - discuss (1 response)     aha! some backing down by the whining one?   it would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that dave's been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support.  i'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours. still have work to do on the sample file, i want to look into the rfc for time-date specs, and get started on the radio implementation of 2.0. i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow, and i want to a little memorial for 9-11. a busy few days for a guy still recovering. also, it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any deal-stoppers.  hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use it!  the poor radio customers!  the poor salon blog users!  they're going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use!  so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage!!!  ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected!  of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card.  what utter fucking nonsense.  this past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his 'blame america' bullshit.  then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss.  now he's trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he's still recovering?  uh, dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights.  we'll still kick your ass regardless.  that's what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave.  no sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.    9/11/02; 1:56:10 pm - discuss     dave is scary on 9/11  posted on scripting news on 9/10/2002:   note: during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news. i'll be in sf at seybold, leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon, apple, google and jake savin of userland. i may be able to update my radio weblog, but only if there's something really important to report. so best wishes for a happy and safe 9-11. what kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! obviously someone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.    9/11/02; 7:56:06 am - discuss     yeow and we though we were harsh!   wow, apparently dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  craig schamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  he wraps it up with:  the man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining buffoon  give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!  related links over at photodude, richard bennett, andrea harris, reid stott, jeff jarvis, ipse dixit, and the fat guy.    9/9/02; 12:29:45 pm - discuss     rss 2.0: code name "hitler"   if dave tries to steamroll rss 2.0 through without formal community consensus, here now we call it the "hitler" release of 2.0.  "no objections"?  no, he means "no objections i choose to hear."  dave is simply not listening.  people are objecting all over.      9/6/02; 9:00:02 am - discuss     referral log funnies   every now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to us.  we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.    9/5/02; 12:15:07 pm - discuss     luserland attempts to trademark "rss"   dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt. scripting news is full of examples.  so we found it surprising, as did many others, when luserland software tried to patent the term 'rss' back in 2000. here's the patent application:  http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336  this was apparently just between the start of the rss 1.0 development efforts, and the publication of the specification. winer knew about the rss 1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.  could dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!  since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do??? a good quote from before he filed the patent application:  tim o'reilly says patents are ok, he's just against stupid patents. in the spirit of touch of grey, tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind. there's no way to route around them.   9/4/02; 6:06:51 am - discuss     when's a permalink not a permalink?   when dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! the permalink links to nothing at that point. so apparently the "perma-" part in permalink is permanent. for everyone except dave. too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!    9/2/02; 6:16:03 pm - discuss

easy_ham,robert harley: btw, i wasn't aware that the 1st amendment mandated that crap must be  forked.  chuck murcko : it doesn't, btw. it says the right to free speech shall not be abridged.  that means *you* can't say anything may not be forked or printed or  whatever.  actually, it means just the opposite. the first amendment guarantees harley's right to say just that. for the outlets where he has editorial control, it even guarantees his right to censor content published through those outlets. the first amendment doesn't limit harley's speech, and it is neutral with regard to the selection policies of fork and other private venues.    _________________________________________________________________ msn photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos:  http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx   
easy_ham,we have a partnership with webex.  we use their serivce for cross-firewall app sharing--something that netmeeting/messenger and sametime require a lot of configuration of firewalls, authentications, access controls and user training for.    now webex has invites, instant meeting launch without any  configuration. users like it as now they have something to do  in between web conferences and places to store and author  documents, reschedule meetings, relaunch meetings.  webex likes  it as people are signed on all the time.    greg    september 19, 2002    tadpole's secure web software subsidiary endeavors technology teams with web   meetings leader webex communications   to provide best-of-breed solution for extended group collaboration during   and between online meetings    web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for   users of the web's secure, p2p collaboration network    ###    tadpole technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure   group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, endeavors   technology, inc., has teamed with web meetings leader, webex   communications,inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time   and resources, and gain competitive advantage. by integrating the advanced   communications capabilities of the webex platform with endeavors' secure p2p   collaboration network, endeavors has created a new method of world-class   teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.    with the rapid growth in popularity of web meetings, the rationale for this   world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around   the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience   between online meetings. the issue by those preferring not to travel is how   to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between   meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple   copies of constantly changing documents.    inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of   time. in asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit   information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than   having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. a secured   environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also   essential.    endeavors' magi technology converts the web into a secure platform for   sharing information directly from people's desktops. webex meetings can be   recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be   actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules   can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at   will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,   inside or outside company firewalls.    magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to web   meeting participants. not only can they share and access information at   will, but they can also know which other participants are online or   "present." this enables them to chat and message each other, search across   other people's magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents   highly productively. with magi collaboration, in tandem with webex   conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,   and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.    "in order to realise the full potential of web meetings, best-of-breed   services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries," says   bernard hulme, tadpole's group chief executive. "the powerful combination   of endeavors' magi and webex's communications technologies will assist   global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by   maintaining teamwork momentum within and between web meetings."    "webex is transforming the way businesses use the web for sales, marketing,   training, support and product design," says david farrington, vice president   of corporate development at webex communications. "by integrating the   communications capabilities of the webex platform with endeavors' secure   collaboration network, endeavors has created an offering that provides the   best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."    about magi   magi enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms   today's web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration   network of files and web resources. for the first time, enterprises can   implement ad-hoc virtual private networks for collaboration very rapidly and   affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work   practices. magi enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming   unsecured, "read-only" web networks into two-way trusted and transparent   collaboration environments, through the use of such features as   cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical   interface, and universal name spaces generating "follow me urls" for mobile   professionals.    about endeavors technology, inc.   endeavors technology, inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing   and network infrastructure vendor tadpole technology plc (lse-tad,   www.tadpole.com), which has plants and offices in irvine and carlsbad   (california), and cambridge, edinburgh, and bristol (uk). for further   information on endeavors' p2p solutions, call 949-833-2800, email to   p2p@endeavors.com, or visit the company's website http://www.endeavors.com.    ends    for further information, please contact:    bernard hulme, tadpole technology - via patcom media   hugh paterson, patcom media - tel 0207 987 4888, email   hughp@patcom-media.com    bullets for editors    webex   web communications services (synchronous): network-based platform for   delivering highly interactive, visually dynamic web communications. the   webex platform supports real-time data, voice and video communications.   webex is the only company to design, develop and deploy a global network for   real-time web communications.    magi   on and off-line (asynchronous) communication and collaboration: cross   enterprise search and discovery, transparent security and trust (ssl & pki),   2-way web access to files and applications, permanent cross firewall access,   ad hoc and permanent secure groups, centralized or decentralized control of   access lists and security privileges, centralized caching of information   (never lose anything critical), multi-device access to information (desktop,   laptop, pda).

(shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough, leaves you with a sinking boat.)  so, "shiver my timbers if i do," can be reasonably interpreted as a more vivid way of saying, "may i die suddenly if i do."  the interpretation suggested by quinion, "may my boat be damaged," neither makes as much sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.  i've sent a copy of this to quinion.

easy_ham,   for my part, i'd rather people didn't use fork as a place in which to dump an   expression of their political beliefs.  i'll second that, although with emphasis upon /dump/, rather than on /political/.  i don't mind if people advocate nuking gay baby whales for jesus, if they can make a good, original, argument for it.  i do mind if someone should attempt to further the notion that 1+1=2, merely by cut-and-pasting a few pages of w&r.

(as found in , quoting gibbon)  now, an economist might argue that selling offices is the most efficient way to fill them (what would coase say?), but wouldn't that convince everyone (but the supporters of plutocracy) that efficiency is not the primary virtue of politics?

easy_ham,well, it looks like sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without mithril.   greg  reuters market news   sun micro outlines roadmap for managing networks    friday september 20, 5:00 am et    by peter henderson     san francisco (reuters) - computer maker sun microsystems inc. on thursday   said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as   straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls n1.    it laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld   unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals   making computers which manage networks.    emc corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage   resources as a pool. hewlett-packard co has a utility data center, designed for   broader management. international business machines corp's project eliza is working   to make computers "self-healing" when systems break.    "applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the   whole idea behind n1 is you stop thinking about that. you don't think about what box   it is running on," sun vice president steve mackay, head of the n1 program, said in an   interview on the sidelines of a sun user conference.     many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or   water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever   needed.    for that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling   them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. there are   still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from   different vendors to interoperate closely.    sun promised to deliver a "virtualization engine" that would let administrators look at   their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. network administrators today   often have no automatic system to report what is in the network.     "it'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out," promised mackay   the second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as   online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, sun said.    finally, in 2004, sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on   the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response   time for priority users, the company said.

easy_ham, a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human   race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.  absolutely correct. perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about  life on earth today.  the following is a fascinating document of official government policy  that bears close reading. it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in  an imperfect world.    the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. it does,   however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the   future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas and this is an   area where america must excel.  i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa,  our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old arabs. it's #1 in  practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in  amman. and it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past bbc and  taking share from every other government broadcaster.  it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long-term  as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term.  many of you may disagree, but i found the document below surprisingly  centrist. if you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re:  icc, taiwan relations act, etc. but, still, this is as much a democratic  platform as not. africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared  they might.  as you read, replace "united states" with "roman empire" and it may make  as much sense, in the long view of history. i don't know how proud to be  about that, but it is telling. sometime i daydream that the president  might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to  our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations  overseas and what they do for us. it would be a powerful education on  how engaged we are in the world around us.  heck, i'd love to see a real-time map of federal expenditures around the  globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research  stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all  the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.  of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the  real news in this document: the bush doctrine for pre-emptive strikes.  i'd sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit  such a principle to be loosed upon the world.  rohit  ----------------------------------------------------- september 20, 2002  full text: bush's national security strategy  following is the full text of president bush's new national security  strategy. the document, entitled "the national security strategy of the  united states," will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of  the administration's policy.  introduction  the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and  totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of  freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,  democracy, and free enterprise. in the twenty-first century, only  nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and  guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the  potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. people  everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;  worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own  property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. these values of freedom  are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of  protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of  freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.  today, the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military  strength and great economic and political influence. in keeping with our  heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for  unilateral advantage. we seek instead to create a balance of power that  favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies  can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and  economic liberty. by making the world safer, we allow the people of the  world to make their own lives better. we will defend this just peace  against threats from terrorists and tyrants. we will preserve the peace  by building good relations among the great powers. we will extend the  peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.  defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental  commitment of the federal government. today, that task has changed  dramatically. enemies in the past needed great armies and great  industrial capabilities to endanger america. now, shadowy networks of  individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less  than it costs to purchase a single tank. terrorists are organized to  penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies  against us.  to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --  from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and  cutting off terrorist financing. the war against terrorists of global  reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. america will help  nations that need our assistance in combating terror. and america will  hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the  allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. the united states and  countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop  new home bases. together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every  turn.  the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism  and technology. our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking  weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing  so with determination. the united states will not allow these efforts to  succeed. we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other  means of delivery. we will cooperate with other nations to deny,  contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous  technologies. and, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, america  will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. we  cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best. so we must  be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence  and proceeding with deliberation. history will judge harshly those who  saw this coming danger but failed to act. in the new world we have  entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.  as we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic  opportunity to preserve the peace. today, the international community  has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the  seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace  instead of continually prepare for war. today, the world's great powers  find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist  violence and chaos. the united states will build on these common  interests to promote global security. we are also increasingly united by  common values. russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching  for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. chinese  leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of  national wealth. in time, they will find that social and political  freedom is the only source of national greatness. america will encourage  the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,  because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and  international order. we will strongly resist aggression from other great  powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,  trade, and cultural advancement.  finally, the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend  the benefits of freedom across the globe. we will actively work to bring  the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to  every corner of the world. the events of september 11, 2001, taught us  that weak states, like afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our  national interests as strong states. poverty does not make poor people  into terrorists and murderers. yet poverty, weak institutions, and  corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and  drug cartels within their borders.  the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a  better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. free  trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies  out of poverty -- so the united states will work with individual  nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to  build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.  the united states will deliver greater development assistance through  the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly,  invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. we will also  continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of  aids and other infectious diseases.  in building a balance of power that favors freedom, the united states is  guided by the conviction that all nations have important  responsibilities. nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.  nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the  spread of weapons of mass destruction. nations that seek international  aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. for  freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.  we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,  better world alone. alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply  the strength of freedom-loving nations. the united states is committed  to lasting institutions like the united nations, the world trade  organization, the organization of american states, and nato as well as  other long-standing alliances. coalitions of the willing can augment  these permanent institutions. in all cases, international obligations  are to be taken seriously. they are not to be undertaken symbolically to  rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.  freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of  every person -- in every civilization. throughout history, freedom has  been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the  clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and  it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. today, humanity  holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all  these foes. the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in  this great mission.  i. overview of america's international strategy   "our nation's cause has always been larger than our nation's defense. we  fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors  liberty. we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists  and tyrants. we will preserve the peace by building good relations among  the great powers. and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and  open societies on every continent."       president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002    the united states possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength  and influence in the world. sustained by faith in the principles of  liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with  unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. the great  strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that  favors freedom.  for most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great  struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and  equality.  that great struggle is over. the militant visions of class, nation, and  race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and  discredited. america is now threatened less by conquering states than we  are by failing ones. we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by  catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. we must  defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.  this is also a time of opportunity for america. we will work to  translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,  and liberty. the u.s. national security strategy will be based on a  distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our  values and our national interests. the aim of this strategy is to help  make the world not just safer but better. our goals on the path to  progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations  with other states, and respect for human dignity.  and this path is not america's alone. it is open to all.  to achieve these goals, the united states will:  * champion aspirations for human dignity;  * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends;  * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;  * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our  friends, with weapons of mass destruction;  * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade;  * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy;  * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of  global power; and  * transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.   ii. champion aspirations for human dignity   "some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the  language of right and wrong. i disagree. different circumstances require  different methods, but not different moralities."      president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002    in pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we  stand for: the united states must defend liberty and justice because  these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. no nation  owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. fathers and  mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live  free from poverty and violence. no people on earth yearn to be  oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of  the secret police.  america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human  dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;  free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;  religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.  these demands can be met in many ways. america's constitution has served  us well. many other nations, with different histories and cultures,  facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these  core principles into their own systems of governance. history has not  been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and  aspirations of their people.  our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. but even in  our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the declaration of  independence were there to guide us. as a result, america is not just a  stronger, but is a freer and more just society.  today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. and  when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central  and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991, or in belgrade in 2000. when  we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in  the republic of korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in latin  america and africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can  evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all  cherish.  embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,  the national security strategy of the united states must start from  these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.  our principles will guide our government's decisions about international  cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation  of resources. they will guide our actions and our words in international  bodies.  we will:  * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of  human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to  advance freedom;  * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who  struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward  democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;  * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key  themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation  from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights  to move toward a better future; and  * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience  and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.   we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist  it.  iii. strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends   "just three days removed from these events, americans do not yet have  the distance of history. but our responsibility to history is already  clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. war has been  waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. this nation is  peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. the conflict was begun on  the timing and terms of others. it will end in a way, and at an hour, of  our choosing."      president bush washington, d.c. (the national cathedral) september 14, 2001    the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of  global reach. the enemy is not a single political regime or person or  religion or ideology. the enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,  politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.  in many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a  lasting peace. such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed  within a political process. but no cause justifies terror. the united  states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals  with them. we make no distinction between terrorists and those who  knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.  the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in  our history. it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly  elusive enemy over an extended period of time. progress will come  through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some  unseen.  today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,  and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to  achieve their political goals. afghanistan has been liberated; coalition  forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al-qaida. but it is not  only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. thousands of  trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america, south  america, europe, africa, the middle east, and across asia.  our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist  organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,  control, and communications; material support; and finances. this will  have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.  we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a  coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. once the regional  campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure  the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial  tools necessary to finish the task.  the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the  financing of terrorism. we will identify and block the sources of  funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who  support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial  system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,  and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative  financial networks.  however, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the  cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we  seek.  we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:  * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and  international power. our immediate focus will be those terrorist  organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of  terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction  (wmd) or their precursors;  * defending the united states, the american people, and our interests  at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it  reaches our borders. while the united states will constantly strive to  enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate  to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by  acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing  harm against our people and our country; and  * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists  by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign  responsibilities.   we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international  terrorism. this includes:  * using the full influence of the united states, and working closely  with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are  illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as  slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government  can condone or support and all must oppose;  * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the muslim  world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote  terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;  * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by  enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources  on areas most at risk; and  * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of  information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of  those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.   while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also  strengthening america's homeland security to protect against and deter  attack.  this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization  since the truman administration created the national security council  and the department of defense. centered on a new department of homeland  security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental  reordering of the fbi, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland  encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public  and the private sector.  this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. for example,  emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with  terrorism but with all hazards. our medical system will be strengthened  to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and  mass-casualty dangers. our border controls will not just stop  terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.  while our focus is protecting america, we know that to defeat terrorism  in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.  wherever possible, the united states will rely on regional organizations  and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. where  governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we  will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and  our allies can provide.  as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan, we will continue to work  with international organizations such as the united nations, as well as  non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the  humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to  rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,  threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists  in the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are  ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. freedom  and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this  conflict. in leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,  productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in  ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.  iv. work with others to defuse regional conflicts   "we build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.  the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements  look so small."      president bush berlin, germany may 23, 2002    concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional  disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. in  an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our  alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create  horrifying affronts to human dignity. when violence erupts and states  falter, the united states will work with friends and partners to  alleviate suffering and restore stability.  no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u.s. action --  direct or indirect -- is warranted. we have finite political, economic,  and military resources to meet our global priorities. the united states  will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:  * the united states should invest time and resources into building  international relationships and institutions that can help manage local  crises when they emerge.  * the united states should be realistic about its ability to help  those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. where and when  people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.   policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will  apply these principles:  the israeli-palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of  human suffering, because of america's close relationship with the state  of israel and key arab states, and because of that region's importance  to other global priorities of the united states. there can be no peace  for either side without freedom for both sides. america stands committed  to an independent and democratic palestine, living beside israel in  peace and security. like all other people, palestinians deserve a  government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and  counts their votes. the united states will continue to encourage all  parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and  comprehensive settlement to the conflict.  the united states, the international donor community, and the world bank  stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic  development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to  establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. if  palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront  corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on american support  for the creation of a palestinian state.  israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine.  permanent occupation threatens israel's identity and democracy. so the  united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete  steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible palestinian state.  as there is progress towards security, israel forces need to withdraw  fully to positions they held prior to september 28, 2000. and consistent  with the recommendations of the mitchell committee, israeli settlement  activity in the occupied territories must stop. as violence subsides,  freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent palestinians  to resume work and normal life. the united states can play a crucial  role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when israelis and  palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.  in south asia, the united states has also emphasized the need for india  and pakistan to resolve their disputes. this administration invested  time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and  pakistan. these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a  constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. with  pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan's  choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more  open and tolerant society. the administration sees india's potential to  become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century  and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. our  involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in  bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan  that can help defuse military confrontation.  indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and  respect for the rule of law. by tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting  the rule of law, and accepting open markets, indonesia may be able to  employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its  neighbors out of poverty and desperation. it is the initiative by  indonesia that allows u.s. assistance to make a difference.  in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with  countries that share our priorities, particularly mexico, brazil,  canada, chile, and colombia. together we will promote a truly democratic  hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,  opportunity, and hope. we will work with regional institutions, such as  the summit of the americas process, the organization of american states  (oas), and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of  the entire hemisphere.  parts of latin america confront regional conflict, especially arising  from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. this conflict  and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and  security of the united states. therefore we have developed an active  strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies, enforce  their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of  drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs  in our own country.  in colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist  groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking  activities that help finance the operations of such groups. we are  working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat  illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective  sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic  security to the colombian people.  in africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,  and desperate poverty. this threatens both a core value of the united  states -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --  combating global terror. american interests and american principles,  therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an  african continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.  together with our european allies, we must help strengthen africa's  fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous  borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence  infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.  an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars  spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. forming coalitions  of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to  confronting these emerging transnational threats.  africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that  focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. this  administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the  region:  * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south  africa, nigeria, kenya, and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement  and require focused attention;  * coordination with european allies and international institutions is  essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace  operations; and  * africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations  must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational  threats on a sustained basis.   ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the  surest route to progress in sub-saharan africa, where most wars are  conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically  waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. the transition to  the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a  common responsibility for democratic political systems offers  opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.  v. prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction   "the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and  technology. when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear  weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,  even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to  strike great nations. our enemies have declared this very intention, and  have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. they want the  capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and  we will oppose them with all our power."      president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002    the nature of the cold war threat required the united states -- with our  allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of  force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. with the  collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war, our security  environment has undergone profound transformation.  having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our  relationship with russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the  balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear  arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as  counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were  inconceivable.  but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.  none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power  that was arrayed against us by the soviet union. however, the nature and  motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain  destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest  states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass  destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex  and dangerous.  in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue  states that, while different in important ways, share a number of  attributes. these states:  * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources  for the personal gain of the rulers;  * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,  and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;  * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with  other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively  to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;  * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and  * reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything  for which it stands.   at the time of the gulf war, we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq's  designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against  iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear  weapons and biological agents. in the past decade north korea has become  the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested  increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal.  other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as  well. these states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has  become a looming threat to all nations.  we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients  before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction  against the united states and our allies and friends. our response must  take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new  partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military  forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective  missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence  collection and analysis.  our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes:  * proactive counterproliferation efforts. we must deter and defend  against the threat before it is unleashed. we must ensure that key  capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce  capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our  homeland security systems. counterproliferation must also be integrated  into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of  our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd-armed  adversaries.  * strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and  terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise  necessary for weapons of mass destruction. we will enhance diplomacy,  arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction  assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd, and when  necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. we will  continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their  increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and  threat reduction programs. the recent g-8 agreement to commit up to $20  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step  forward.  * effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd  use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. minimizing the effects of  wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such  weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading  enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. the united states  must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our  forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.   it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of  this new threat. given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the  united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have  in the past. the inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy  of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be  caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.  we cannot let our enemies strike first.  * in the cold war, especially following the cuban missile crisis, we  faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. deterrence was an  effective defense. but deterrence based only upon the threat of  retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states  more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and  the wealth of their nations.  * in the cold war, weapons of mass destruction were considered  weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who  used them. today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons  of choice. for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and  military aggression against their neighbors. these weapons may also  allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our  allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior  of rogue states. such states also see these weapons as their best means  of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states.  * traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a  terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the  targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death  and whose most potent protection is statelessness. the overlap between  states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to  action.   for centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer  an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves  against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. legal scholars  and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption  on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible  mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.  we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and  objectives of today's adversaries. rogue states and terrorists do not  seek to attack us using conventional means. they know such attacks would  fail. instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use  of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed  and delivered covertly and without warning.  the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian  population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law  of warfare. as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11, 2001,  mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and  these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired  and used weapons of mass destruction.  the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions  to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. the greater the  threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling  the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if  uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. to  forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the united  states will, if necessary, act preemptively.  the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging  threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.  yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek  the world's most destructive technologies, the united states cannot  remain idle while dangers gather.  we will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our  actions. to support preemptive options, we will:  * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide  timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;  * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the  most dangerous threats; and  * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to  conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.   the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat  to the united states or our allies and friends. the reasons for our  actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.  vi. ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade.   "when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a  privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever  enough. when nations respect their people, open markets, invest in  better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade  revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."      president bush monterrey, mexico march 22, 2002    a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing  prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. economic growth  supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher  incomes. it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs  economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it  reinforces the habits of liberty.  we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america's  shores. all governments are responsible for creating their own economic  policies and responding to their own economic challenge. we will use our  economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of  policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic  growth, including:  * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business  investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;  * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that  improve incentives for work and investment;  * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are  confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic  endeavors;  * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most  efficient use;  * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;  * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and  skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and  * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the  diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and  opportunity.   the lessons of history are clear: market economies, not  command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the  best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. policies that further  strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for  all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the  developing world.  a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u.s.  national security interests. we want our allies to have strong economies  for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake  of global security. european efforts to remove structural barriers in  their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are  japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of  non-performing loans in the japanese banking system. we will continue to  use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners --  including through the group of seven (g-7) -- to discuss policies they  are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher  global economic growth.  improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic  growth. international flows of investment capital are needed to expand  the productive potential of these economies. these flows allow emerging  markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise  living standards and reduce poverty. our long-term objective should be a  world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that  allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in  their future.  we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve  access to larger capital flows at lower cost. to this end, we will  continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial  markets. we will work actively with other countries, the international  monetary fund (imf), and the private sector to implement the g-7 action  plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and  more effectively resolving them when they occur.  the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from  occurring, and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing  so. we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy  conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on  achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,  exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.  the concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it  became a pillar of economics. if you can make something that others  value, you should be able to sell it to them. if others make something  that you value, you should be able to buy it. this is real freedom, the  freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. to promote free  trade, the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy:  * seize the global initiative. the new global trade negotiations we  helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,  especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for  completion in 2005. the united states has led the way in completing the  accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade  organization. we will assist russia's preparations to join the wto.  * press regional initiatives. the united states and other democracies  in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of  the americas, targeted for completion in 2005. this year the united  states will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,  targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and  government procurement. we will also offer more opportunity to the  poorest continent, africa, starting with full use of the preferences  allowed in the african growth and opportunity act, and leading to free  trade.  * move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. building on the  free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001, the administration  will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and  singapore. our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of  developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.  initially, central america, southern africa, morocco, and australia will  be our principal focal points.  * renew the executive-congressional partnership. every  administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with  congress. after a gap of 8 years, the administration reestablished  majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing  trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for  developing countries in the trade act of 2002. this administration will  work with congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade  agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade  promotion authority.  * promote the connection between trade and development. trade  policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,  competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open  societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional  integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in  developing countries. the united states is implementing the africa  growth and opportunity act to provide market-access for nearly all goods  produced in the 35 countries of sub-saharan africa. we will make more  use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue  to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer  countries take advantage of these opportunities. beyond market access,  the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public  health. we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are  flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical  medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv/aids, tuberculosis, and  malaria.  * enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.  commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on  enforceable agreements. our top priorities are to resolve ongoing  disputes with the european union, canada, and mexico and to make a  global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations  that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. laws  against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international  community must be able to address genuine concerns about government  subsidies and dumping. international industrial espionage which  undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.  * help domestic industries and workers adjust. there is a sound  statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used  in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the  american steel industry. the benefits of free trade depend upon the  enforcement of fair trading practices. these safeguards help ensure that  the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american  workers. trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the  change and dynamism of open markets.  * protect the environment and workers. the united states must foster  economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with  widening prosperity. we will incorporate labor and environmental  concerns into u.s. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network"  between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto, and use the  international labor organization, trade preference programs, and trade  talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.  * enhance energy security. we will strengthen our own energy security  and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our  allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and  types of global energy supplied, especially in the western hemisphere,  africa, central asia, and the caspian region. we will also continue to  work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient  technologies.   economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize  greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing  them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the  global climate. our overall objective is to reduce america's greenhouse  gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such  emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10  years, by the year 2012. our strategies for attaining this goal will be  to:  * remain committed to the basic u.n. framework convention for  international cooperation;  * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of  the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to  companies that can show real cuts;  * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission  reductions;  * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as  well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,  while also improving fuel economy for u.s. cars and trucks;  * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to  a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change  by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's  budget; and  * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas  emitters such as china and india, so that they will have the tools and  resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and  better path.   vii. expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy   "in world war ii we fought to make the world safer, then worked to  rebuild it. as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we  must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."      president bush washington, d.c. (inter-american development bank) march 14, 2002    a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human  race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. including  all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and  opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of  u.s. international policy.  decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic  growth in the poorest countries. worse, development aid has often served  to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and  perpetuating misery. results of aid are typically measured in dollars  spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction  achieved by recipients. these are the indicators of a failed strategy.  working with other nations, the united states is confronting this  failure. we forged a new consensus at the u.n. conference on financing  for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and  the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.  this administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential  of individuals in all nations. sustained growth and poverty reduction is  impossible without the right national policies. where governments have  implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels  of assistance. the united states and other developed countries should  set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's  poorest economies within a decade.  the united states government will pursue these major strategies to  achieve this goal:  * provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of  national reform. we propose a 50 percent increase in the core  development assistance given by the united states. while continuing our  present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,  these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge  account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest  in their people, and encourage economic freedom. governments must fight  corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest  in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and  enable entrepreneurship. the millennium challenge account will reward  countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those  that have not to implement reforms.  * improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development  banks in raising living standards. the united states is committed to a  comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other  multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of  the world's poor. we have reversed the downward trend in u.s.  contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the u.s.  contributions to the international development association (ida) -- the  world bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the african  development fund. the key to raising living standards and reducing  poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially  in the poorest countries. we will continue to press the multilateral  development banks to focus on activities that increase economic  productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,  and private sector development. every project, every loan, every grant  must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in  developing countries.  * insist upon measurable results to ensure that development  assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's  poor. when it comes to economic development, what really matters is that  more children are getting a better education, more people have access to  health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a  better future for their families. we have a moral obligation to measure  the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering  results. for this reason, we will continue to demand that our own  development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral  development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for  achieving those goals. thanks to u.s. leadership, the recent ida  replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation  system that measures recipient countries' progress. for the first time,  donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the  achievement of actual development results, and part of the u.s.  contribution is linked in this way. we will strive to make sure that the  world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this  progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything  that these institutions do.  * increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in  the form of grants instead of loans. greater use of results-based grants  is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,  particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with  ever-larger debt burdens. as a result of u.s. leadership, the recent ida  agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the  poorest countries for education, hiv/aids, health, nutrition, water,  sanitation, and other human needs. our goal is to build on that progress  by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development  banks. we will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private  sector to match government efforts by using grants to support  development projects that show results.  * open societies to commerce and investment. trade and investment are  the real engines of economic growth. even if government aid increases,  most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and  foreign investment. an effective strategy must try to expand these flows  as well. free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national  security strategy.  * secure public health. the scale of the public health crisis in poor  countries is enormous. in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics  like hiv/aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be  threatened until these scourges can be contained. resources from the  developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest  governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective  local infrastructure. the united states has strongly backed the new  global fund for hiv/aids organized by u.n. secretary general kofi annan  and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for  treatment and care. the united states already contributes more than  twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. if the  global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.  * emphasize education. literacy and learning are the foundation of  democracy and development. only about 7 percent of world bank resources  are devoted to education. this proportion should grow. the united states  will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher  training in africa. the united states can also bring information  technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been  devastated by aids.  * continue to aid agricultural development. new technologies,  including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields  in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.  using sound science, the united states should help bring these benefits  to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still  suffer from hunger and malnutrition.   viii. develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers  of global power   "we have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th  century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead  of prepare for war."      president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002    america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as  broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance  of power that favors freedom. effective coalition leadership requires  clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent  consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.  there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can  accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies  and friends in canada and europe. europe is also the seat of two of the  strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the  north atlantic treaty organization (nato), which has, since its  inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-european  security, and the european union (eu), our partner in opening world  trade.  the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato, as nato itself  recognized when it invoked its article v self-defense clause for the  first time. nato's core mission -- collective defense of the  transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but nato must develop  new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new  circumstances. nato must build a capability to field, at short notice,  highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to  respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.  the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,  creating coalitions under nato's own mandate, as well as contributing to  mission-based coalitions. to achieve this, we must:  * expand nato's membership to those democratic nations willing and  able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;  * ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate  combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;  * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become  effective multinational fighting forces;  * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of  scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that  they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;  * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to  meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of  training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;  and  * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as  we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.   if nato succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a  partnership as central to the security and interests of its member  states as was the case during the cold war. we will sustain a common  perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to  take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. at the  same time, we welcome our european allies' efforts to forge a greater  foreign policy and defense identity with the eu, and commit ourselves to  close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato. we  cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of  transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.  the attacks of september 11 energized america's asian alliances.  australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an  attack on australia itself, following that historic decision with the  dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for operation  enduring freedom. japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented  levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist  attack. we have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our  alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received  invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand.  the war against terrorism has proven that america's alliances in asia  not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and  ready to deal with new challenges. to enhance our asian alliances and  friendships, we will:   * look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and  global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our  close defense and diplomatic cooperation;  * work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while  preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of  the region over the longer-term;  * build on 50 years of u.s.-australian alliance cooperation as we  continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as  we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora;  * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our  allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic  environment; and  * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with  institutions such as asean and the asia-pacific economic cooperation  forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage  change in this dynamic region.   we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power  competition. several potential great powers are now in the midst of  internal transition -- most importantly russia, india, and china. in all  three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly  global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.  with russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based  on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the united states and  russia are no longer strategic adversaries. the moscow treaty on  strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a  critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,  long-term relations with the euro-atlantic community and the united  states. russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their  country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --  needed to reverse those weaknesses. they understand, increasingly, that  cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that  russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas.  united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to  refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and  challenges. we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the  global war on terrorism. we are facilitating russia's entry into the  world trade organization, without lowering standards for accession, to  promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. we have  created the nato-russia council with the goal of deepening security  cooperation among russia, our european allies, and ourselves. we will  continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the  former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable  neighborhood will reinforce russia's growing commitment to integration  into the euro-atlantic community.  at the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still  divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to  build an enduring strategic partnership. lingering distrust of our  motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our  relations. russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market  democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. russia's very  weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. nevertheless, those  opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even  decades.  the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral  relationship with india based on a conviction that u.s. interests  require a strong relationship with india. we are the two largest  democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative  government. india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. we  have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through  the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean. finally, we share an interest  in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia.  differences remain, including over the development of india's nuclear  and missile programs, and the pace of india's economic reforms. but  while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about  india, today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with  which we have common strategic interests. through a strong partnership  with india, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic  future.  the united states relationship with china is an important part of our  strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous asia-pacific  region. we welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous  china. the democratic development of china is crucial to that future.  yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst  features of the communist legacy, china's leaders have not yet made the  next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.  in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its  neighbors in the asia-pacific region, china is following an outdated  path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national  greatness. in time, china will find that social and political freedom is  the only source of that greatness.  the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing  china. we already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including  the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean  peninsula. likewise, we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan  and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and  similar transitional concerns. shared health and environmental threats,  such as the spread of hiv/aids, challenge us to promote jointly the  welfare of our citizens.  addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become  more open with information, promote the development of civil society,  and enhance individual human rights. china has begun to take the road to  political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting  village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national  one-party rule by the communist party. to make that nation truly  accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work  remains to be done. only by allowing the chinese people to think,  assemble, and worship freely can china reach its full potential.  our important trade relationship will benefit from china's entry into  the world trade organization, which will create more export  opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers, workers,  and companies. china is our fourth largest trading partner, with over  $100 billion in annual two-way trade. the power of market principles and  the wto's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance  openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic  protections for commerce and for citizens. there are, however, other  areas in which we have profound disagreements. our commitment to the  self-defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one. human  rights is another. we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation  commitments. we will work to narrow differences where they exist, but  not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.  the events of september 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for  relations between the united states and other main centers of global  power, and opened vast, new opportunities. with our long-standing allies  in europe and asia, and with leaders in russia, india, and china, we  must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships  become routine and unproductive.  every agency of the united states government shares the challenge. we  can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober  analysis, and common action. in the long-term, these are the practices  that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open  the path of progress.  ix. transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century   "terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity. they did not touch  its source. america is successful because of the hard work, creativity,  and enterprise of our people."      president bush washington, d.c. (joint session of congress) september 20, 2001    the major institutions of american national security were designed in a  different era to meet different requirements. all of them must be  transformed.  it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength.  we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. our military's  highest priority is to defend the united states. to do so effectively,  our military must:  * assure our allies and friends;  * dissuade future military competition;  * deter threats against u.s. interests, allies, and friends; and  * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.   the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces, and their  forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most  strategically vital regions. however, the threats and enemies we must  confront have changed, and so must our forces. a military structured to  deter massive cold war-era armies must be transformed to focus more on  how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might  occur. we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational  challenges.  the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound  symbols of the u.s. commitments to allies and friends. through our  willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,  the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of  power that favors freedom. to contend with uncertainty and to meet the  many security challenges we face, the united states will require bases  and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia, as  well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment  of u.s. forces.  before the war in afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major  planning contingencies. yet, in a very short time, we had to operate  across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch  of the armed forces. we must prepare for more such deployments by  developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision  strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.  this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the  ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure  u.s. access to distant theaters, and protect critical u.s.  infrastructure and assets in outer space.  innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new  approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting u.s.  intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and  technology. we must also transform the way the department of defense is  run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.  finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight  the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the president with a  wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of  coercion against the united states, our allies, and our friends.  we know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from  experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. the united states must  and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --  whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the united  states, our allies, or our friends. we will maintain the forces  sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. our forces  will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a  military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the  united states.  intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense  against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. designed  around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,  fixed object -- the soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping  with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of  targets.  we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to  keep pace with the nature of these threats. intelligence must be  appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems  and coordinated with our allies and friends. we need to protect the  capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the  knowledge of how best to surprise us. those who would harm us also seek  the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and  to maximize injury.  we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide  integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. since  the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted  inside the united states, we must also ensure the proper fusion of  information between intelligence and law enforcement.  initiatives in this area will include:  * strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence  to lead the development and actions of the nation's foreign intelligence  capabilities;  * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides  seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing  the nation and our allies;  * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to  sustain our intelligence advantage;  * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them  through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence  capabilities; and  * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the  government with all-source analysis.   as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend  america's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other  nations. we will ensure that the department of state receives funding  sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy. the state  department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with  other governments. and in this new era, its people and institutions must  be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations  and international institutions. officials trained mainly in  international politics must also extend their reach to understand  complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public  health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.  our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil  wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. as humanitarian relief  requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build  police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial  government institutions, and electoral systems. effective international  cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by american  readiness to play our part.  just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out  to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to  public information efforts that can help people around the world learn  about and understand america. the war on terrorism is not a clash of  civilizations. it does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,  a battle for the future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas  and this is an area where america must excel.  we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet  our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired  by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the  international criminal court (icc), whose jurisdiction does not extend  to americans and which we do not accept. we will work together with  other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and  cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral  agreements that will protect u.s. nationals from the icc. we will  implement fully the american servicemembers protection act, whose  provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u.s.  personnel and officials.  we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the  right level and allocation of government spending on national security.  the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this  war. at home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for  the american people.  today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is  diminishing. in a globalized world, events beyond america's borders have  a greater impact inside them. our society must be open to people, ideas,  and goods from across the globe. the characteristics we most cherish --  our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are  vulnerable to terrorism. this vulnerability will persist long after we  bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks.  as time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that  until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. this  is a new condition of life. we will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite  of it.  in exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and  interests of our friends and partners. still, we will be prepared to act  apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. when we  disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for  our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. we will not allow  such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with  our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.  ultimately, the foundation of american strength is at home. it is in the  skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of  our institutions. a diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,  entrepreneurial energy. our strength comes from what we do with that  energy. that is where our national security begins.

easy_ham,glm whereas political brochures are not; the statistics clearly show glm which is the greater, more senseless, and more preventable killer.  so outside of the occasional hit by a mafia-boy, where's the killing?  if you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, i'd agree.  but, does politics really kill?  i'm bitter atm.  two reasons mostly: 1) i was listening to what i heard being the first amendment foundation? on npr releasing a poll noting that their very-unscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first amendment goes too far.   and (their quote was 1 in 5, but i'm finding sources of 1 in 4) of the population don't even know what rights are guaranteed in the first amendment.  2) i have a paper due that will make or break my law school career.  i hate being a forced sheep.  baaaa....

easy_ham,gary lawrence murphy: ok, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)  since it was my quip, i'll point out that i used the term "alcoholism," implying addiction. i drink. i'm not an alcoholic. most people who drink don't go to aa meetings. most people who go to aa meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.  as to religion, i think it is harmful and risky in almost any degree. were i single, i might consider potential mates who partook of the less irrational or more light-hearted religions. a unitarian or buddhist might be an example of the first, a wiccan of the second. but someone who is both irrational and serious about that irrationality strikes me as a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who was addicted to some drug. alcoholics and drug addicts at least have the sense to battle their problem, and to keep their children from suffering it. the religious revel in their irrationality, and want to raise their children in it. that's a difficult difference for two parents to reconcile.  fortunately, i am long and happily enamored of someone who has no religious tendencies.     _________________________________________________________________ send and receive hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com

easy_ham, "free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty" i'm not a socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear examples?   ----- original message ----- from: "rohit khare"  to:  sent: friday, september 20, 2002 5:10 pm subject: sed /s/united states/roman empire/g     a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human   race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.   absolutely correct. perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about  life on earth today.   the following is a fascinating document of official government policy  that bears close reading. it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in  an imperfect world.     the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. it does,   however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the   future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas and this is an   area where america must excel.   i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa,  our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old arabs. it's #1 in  practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in  amman. and it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past bbc and  taking share from every other government broadcaster.   it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long-term  as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term.   many of you may disagree, but i found the document below surprisingly  centrist. if you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re:  icc, taiwan relations act, etc. but, still, this is as much a democratic  platform as not. africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared  they might.   as you read, replace "united states" with "roman empire" and it may make  as much sense, in the long view of history. i don't know how proud to be  about that, but it is telling. sometime i daydream that the president  might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to  our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations  overseas and what they do for us. it would be a powerful education on  how engaged we are in the world around us.   heck, i'd love to see a real-time map of federal expenditures around the  globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research  stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all  the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.   of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the  real news in this document: the bush doctrine for pre-emptive strikes.  i'd sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit  such a principle to be loosed upon the world.   rohit   -----------------------------------------------------  september 20, 2002   full text: bush's national security strategy   following is the full text of president bush's new national security  strategy. the document, entitled "the national security strategy of the  united states," will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of  the administration's policy.   introduction   the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and  totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of  freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,  democracy, and free enterprise. in the twenty-first century, only  nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and  guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the  potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. people  everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;  worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own  property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. these values of freedom  are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of  protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of  freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.   today, the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military  strength and great economic and political influence. in keeping with our  heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for  unilateral advantage. we seek instead to create a balance of power that  favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies  can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and  economic liberty. by making the world safer, we allow the people of the  world to make their own lives better. we will defend this just peace  against threats from terrorists and tyrants. we will preserve the peace  by building good relations among the great powers. we will extend the  peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.   defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental  commitment of the federal government. today, that task has changed  dramatically. enemies in the past needed great armies and great  industrial capabilities to endanger america. now, shadowy networks of  individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less  than it costs to purchase a single tank. terrorists are organized to  penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies  against us.   to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --  from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and  cutting off terrorist financing. the war against terrorists of global  reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. america will help  nations that need our assistance in combating terror. and america will  hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the  allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. the united states and  countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop  new home bases. together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every  turn.   the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism  and technology. our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking  weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing  so with determination. the united states will not allow these efforts to  succeed. we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other  means of delivery. we will cooperate with other nations to deny,  contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous  technologies. and, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, america  will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. we  cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best. so we must  be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence  and proceeding with deliberation. history will judge harshly those who  saw this coming danger but failed to act. in the new world we have  entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.   as we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic  opportunity to preserve the peace. today, the international community  has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the  seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace  instead of continually prepare for war. today, the world's great powers  find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist  violence and chaos. the united states will build on these common  interests to promote global security. we are also increasingly united by  common values. russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching  for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. chinese  leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of  national wealth. in time, they will find that social and political  freedom is the only source of national greatness. america will encourage  the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,  because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and  international order. we will strongly resist aggression from other great  powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,  trade, and cultural advancement.   finally, the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend  the benefits of freedom across the globe. we will actively work to bring  the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to  every corner of the world. the events of september 11, 2001, taught us  that weak states, like afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our  national interests as strong states. poverty does not make poor people  into terrorists and murderers. yet poverty, weak institutions, and  corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and  drug cartels within their borders.   the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a  better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. free  trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies  out of poverty -- so the united states will work with individual  nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to  build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.  the united states will deliver greater development assistance through  the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly,  invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. we will also  continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of  aids and other infectious diseases.   in building a balance of power that favors freedom, the united states is  guided by the conviction that all nations have important  responsibilities. nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.  nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the  spread of weapons of mass destruction. nations that seek international  aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. for  freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.   we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,  better world alone. alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply  the strength of freedom-loving nations. the united states is committed  to lasting institutions like the united nations, the world trade  organization, the organization of american states, and nato as well as  other long-standing alliances. coalitions of the willing can augment  these permanent institutions. in all cases, international obligations  are to be taken seriously. they are not to be undertaken symbolically to  rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.   freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of  every person -- in every civilization. throughout history, freedom has  been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the  clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and  it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. today, humanity  holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all  these foes. the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in  this great mission.   i. overview of america's international strategy    "our nation's cause has always been larger than our nation's defense. we  fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors  liberty. we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists  and tyrants. we will preserve the peace by building good relations among  the great powers. and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and  open societies on every continent."        president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     the united states possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength  and influence in the world. sustained by faith in the principles of  liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with  unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. the great  strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that  favors freedom.   for most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great  struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and  equality.   that great struggle is over. the militant visions of class, nation, and  race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and  discredited. america is now threatened less by conquering states than we  are by failing ones. we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by  catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. we must  defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.   this is also a time of opportunity for america. we will work to  translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,  and liberty. the u.s. national security strategy will be based on a  distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our  values and our national interests. the aim of this strategy is to help  make the world not just safer but better. our goals on the path to  progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations  with other states, and respect for human dignity.   and this path is not america's alone. it is open to all.   to achieve these goals, the united states will:   * champion aspirations for human dignity;   * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends;   * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;   * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our  friends, with weapons of mass destruction;   * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade;   * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy;   * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of  global power; and   * transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.    ii. champion aspirations for human dignity    "some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the  language of right and wrong. i disagree. different circumstances require  different methods, but not different moralities."       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     in pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we  stand for: the united states must defend liberty and justice because  these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. no nation  owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. fathers and  mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live  free from poverty and violence. no people on earth yearn to be  oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of  the secret police.   america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human  dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;  free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;  religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.   these demands can be met in many ways. america's constitution has served  us well. many other nations, with different histories and cultures,  facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these  core principles into their own systems of governance. history has not  been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and  aspirations of their people.   our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. but even in  our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the declaration of  independence were there to guide us. as a result, america is not just a  stronger, but is a freer and more just society.   today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. and  when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central  and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991, or in belgrade in 2000. when  we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in  the republic of korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in latin  america and africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can  evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all  cherish.   embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,  the national security strategy of the united states must start from  these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.   our principles will guide our government's decisions about international  cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation  of resources. they will guide our actions and our words in international  bodies.   we will:   * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of  human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to  advance freedom;   * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who  struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward  democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;   * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key  themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation  from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights  to move toward a better future; and   * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience  and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.    we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist  it.   iii. strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends    "just three days removed from these events, americans do not yet have  the distance of history. but our responsibility to history is already  clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. war has been  waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. this nation is  peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. the conflict was begun on  the timing and terms of others. it will end in a way, and at an hour, of  our choosing."       president bush  washington, d.c. (the national cathedral)  september 14, 2001     the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of  global reach. the enemy is not a single political regime or person or  religion or ideology. the enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,  politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.   in many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a  lasting peace. such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed  within a political process. but no cause justifies terror. the united  states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals  with them. we make no distinction between terrorists and those who  knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.   the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in  our history. it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly  elusive enemy over an extended period of time. progress will come  through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some  unseen.   today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,  and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to  achieve their political goals. afghanistan has been liberated; coalition  forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al-qaida. but it is not  only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. thousands of  trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america, south  america, europe, africa, the middle east, and across asia.   our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist  organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,  control, and communications; material support; and finances. this will  have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.   we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a  coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. once the regional  campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure  the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial  tools necessary to finish the task.   the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the  financing of terrorism. we will identify and block the sources of  funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who  support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial  system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,  and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative  financial networks.   however, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the  cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we  seek.   we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:   * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and  international power. our immediate focus will be those terrorist  organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of  terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction  (wmd) or their precursors;   * defending the united states, the american people, and our interests  at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it  reaches our borders. while the united states will constantly strive to  enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate  to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by  acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing  harm against our people and our country; and   * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists  by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign  responsibilities.    we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international  terrorism. this includes:   * using the full influence of the united states, and working closely  with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are  illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as  slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government  can condone or support and all must oppose;   * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the muslim  world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote  terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;   * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by  enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources  on areas most at risk; and   * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of  information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of  those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.    while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also  strengthening america's homeland security to protect against and deter  attack.   this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization  since the truman administration created the national security council  and the department of defense. centered on a new department of homeland  security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental  reordering of the fbi, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland  encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public  and the private sector.   this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. for example,  emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with  terrorism but with all hazards. our medical system will be strengthened  to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and  mass-casualty dangers. our border controls will not just stop  terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.   while our focus is protecting america, we know that to defeat terrorism  in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.  wherever possible, the united states will rely on regional organizations  and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. where  governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we  will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and  our allies can provide.   as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan, we will continue to work  with international organizations such as the united nations, as well as  non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the  humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to  rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,  threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists   in the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are  ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. freedom  and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this  conflict. in leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,  productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in  ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.   iv. work with others to defuse regional conflicts    "we build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.  the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements  look so small."       president bush  berlin, germany  may 23, 2002     concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional  disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. in  an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our  alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create  horrifying affronts to human dignity. when violence erupts and states  falter, the united states will work with friends and partners to  alleviate suffering and restore stability.   no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u.s. action --  direct or indirect -- is warranted. we have finite political, economic,  and military resources to meet our global priorities. the united states  will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:   * the united states should invest time and resources into building  international relationships and institutions that can help manage local  crises when they emerge.   * the united states should be realistic about its ability to help  those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. where and when  people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.    policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will  apply these principles:   the israeli-palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of  human suffering, because of america's close relationship with the state  of israel and key arab states, and because of that region's importance  to other global priorities of the united states. there can be no peace  for either side without freedom for both sides. america stands committed  to an independent and democratic palestine, living beside israel in  peace and security. like all other people, palestinians deserve a  government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and  counts their votes. the united states will continue to encourage all  parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and  comprehensive settlement to the conflict.   the united states, the international donor community, and the world bank  stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic  development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to  establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. if  palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront  corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on american support  for the creation of a palestinian state.   israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine.  permanent occupation threatens israel's identity and democracy. so the  united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete  steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible palestinian state.  as there is progress towards security, israel forces need to withdraw  fully to positions they held prior to september 28, 2000. and consistent  with the recommendations of the mitchell committee, israeli settlement  activity in the occupied territories must stop. as violence subsides,  freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent palestinians  to resume work and normal life. the united states can play a crucial  role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when israelis and  palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.   in south asia, the united states has also emphasized the need for india  and pakistan to resolve their disputes. this administration invested  time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and  pakistan. these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a  constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. with  pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan's  choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more  open and tolerant society. the administration sees india's potential to  become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century  and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. our  involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in  bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan  that can help defuse military confrontation.   indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and  respect for the rule of law. by tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting  the rule of law, and accepting open markets, indonesia may be able to  employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its  neighbors out of poverty and desperation. it is the initiative by  indonesia that allows u.s. assistance to make a difference.   in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with  countries that share our priorities, particularly mexico, brazil,  canada, chile, and colombia. together we will promote a truly democratic  hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,  opportunity, and hope. we will work with regional institutions, such as  the summit of the americas process, the organization of american states  (oas), and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of  the entire hemisphere.   parts of latin america confront regional conflict, especially arising  from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. this conflict  and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and  security of the united states. therefore we have developed an active  strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies, enforce  their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of  drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs  in our own country.   in colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist  groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking  activities that help finance the operations of such groups. we are  working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat  illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective  sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic  security to the colombian people.   in africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,  and desperate poverty. this threatens both a core value of the united  states -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --  combating global terror. american interests and american principles,  therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an  african continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.  together with our european allies, we must help strengthen africa's  fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous  borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence  infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.   an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars  spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. forming coalitions  of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to  confronting these emerging transnational threats.   africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that  focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. this  administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the  region:   * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south  africa, nigeria, kenya, and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement  and require focused attention;   * coordination with european allies and international institutions is  essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace  operations; and   * africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations  must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational  threats on a sustained basis.    ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the  surest route to progress in sub-saharan africa, where most wars are  conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically  waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. the transition to  the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a  common responsibility for democratic political systems offers  opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.   v. prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction    "the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and  technology. when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear  weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,  even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to  strike great nations. our enemies have declared this very intention, and  have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. they want the  capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and  we will oppose them with all our power."       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     the nature of the cold war threat required the united states -- with our  allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of  force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. with the  collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war, our security  environment has undergone profound transformation.   having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our  relationship with russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the  balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear  arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as  counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were  inconceivable.   but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.  none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power  that was arrayed against us by the soviet union. however, the nature and  motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain  destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest  states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass  destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex  and dangerous.   in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue  states that, while different in important ways, share a number of  attributes. these states:   * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources  for the personal gain of the rulers;   * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,  and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;   * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with  other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively  to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;   * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and   * reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything  for which it stands.    at the time of the gulf war, we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq's  designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against  iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear  weapons and biological agents. in the past decade north korea has become  the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested  increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal.  other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as  well. these states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has  become a looming threat to all nations.   we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients  before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction  against the united states and our allies and friends. our response must  take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new  partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military  forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective  missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence  collection and analysis.   our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes:   * proactive counterproliferation efforts. we must deter and defend  against the threat before it is unleashed. we must ensure that key  capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce  capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our  homeland security systems. counterproliferation must also be integrated  into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of  our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd-armed  adversaries.   * strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and  terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise  necessary for weapons of mass destruction. we will enhance diplomacy,  arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction  assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd, and when  necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. we will  continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their  increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and  threat reduction programs. the recent g-8 agreement to commit up to $20  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step  forward.   * effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd  use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. minimizing the effects of  wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such  weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading  enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. the united states  must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our  forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.    it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of  this new threat. given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the  united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have  in the past. the inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy  of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be  caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.  we cannot let our enemies strike first.   * in the cold war, especially following the cuban missile crisis, we  faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. deterrence was an  effective defense. but deterrence based only upon the threat of  retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states  more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and  the wealth of their nations.   * in the cold war, weapons of mass destruction were considered  weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who  used them. today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons  of choice. for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and  military aggression against their neighbors. these weapons may also  allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our  allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior  of rogue states. such states also see these weapons as their best means  of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states.   * traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a  terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the  targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death  and whose most potent protection is statelessness. the overlap between  states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to  action.    for centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer  an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves  against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. legal scholars  and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption  on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible  mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.   we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and  objectives of today's adversaries. rogue states and terrorists do not  seek to attack us using conventional means. they know such attacks would  fail. instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use  of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed  and delivered covertly and without warning.   the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian  population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law  of warfare. as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11, 2001,  mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and  these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired  and used weapons of mass destruction.   the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions  to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. the greater the  threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling  the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if  uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. to  forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the united  states will, if necessary, act preemptively.   the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging  threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.  yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek  the world's most destructive technologies, the united states cannot  remain idle while dangers gather.   we will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our  actions. to support preemptive options, we will:   * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide  timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;   * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the  most dangerous threats; and   * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to  conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.    the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat  to the united states or our allies and friends. the reasons for our  actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.   vi. ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade.    "when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a  privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever  enough. when nations respect their people, open markets, invest in  better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade  revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."       president bush  monterrey, mexico  march 22, 2002     a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing  prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. economic growth  supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher  incomes. it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs  economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it  reinforces the habits of liberty.   we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america's  shores. all governments are responsible for creating their own economic  policies and responding to their own economic challenge. we will use our  economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of  policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic  growth, including:   * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business  investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;   * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that  improve incentives for work and investment;   * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are  confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic  endeavors;   * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most  efficient use;   * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;   * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and  skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and   * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the  diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and  opportunity.    the lessons of history are clear: market economies, not  command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the  best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. policies that further  strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for  all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the  developing world.   a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u.s.  national security interests. we want our allies to have strong economies  for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake  of global security. european efforts to remove structural barriers in  their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are  japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of  non-performing loans in the japanese banking system. we will continue to  use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners --  including through the group of seven (g-7) -- to discuss policies they  are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher  global economic growth.   improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic  growth. international flows of investment capital are needed to expand  the productive potential of these economies. these flows allow emerging  markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise  living standards and reduce poverty. our long-term objective should be a  world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that  allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in  their future.   we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve  access to larger capital flows at lower cost. to this end, we will  continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial  markets. we will work actively with other countries, the international  monetary fund (imf), and the private sector to implement the g-7 action  plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and  more effectively resolving them when they occur.   the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from  occurring, and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing  so. we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy  conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on  achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,  exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.   the concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it  became a pillar of economics. if you can make something that others  value, you should be able to sell it to them. if others make something  that you value, you should be able to buy it. this is real freedom, the  freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. to promote free  trade, the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy:   * seize the global initiative. the new global trade negotiations we  helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,  especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for  completion in 2005. the united states has led the way in completing the  accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade  organization. we will assist russia's preparations to join the wto.   * press regional initiatives. the united states and other democracies  in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of  the americas, targeted for completion in 2005. this year the united  states will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,  targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and  government procurement. we will also offer more opportunity to the  poorest continent, africa, starting with full use of the preferences  allowed in the african growth and opportunity act, and leading to free  trade.   * move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. building on the  free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001, the administration  will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and  singapore. our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of  developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.  initially, central america, southern africa, morocco, and australia will  be our principal focal points.   * renew the executive-congressional partnership. every  administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with  congress. after a gap of 8 years, the administration reestablished  majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing  trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for  developing countries in the trade act of 2002. this administration will  work with congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade  agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade  promotion authority.   * promote the connection between trade and development. trade  policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,  competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open  societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional  integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in  developing countries. the united states is implementing the africa  growth and opportunity act to provide market-access for nearly all goods  produced in the 35 countries of sub-saharan africa. we will make more  use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue  to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer  countries take advantage of these opportunities. beyond market access,  the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public  health. we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are  flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical  medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv/aids, tuberculosis, and  malaria.   * enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.  commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on  enforceable agreements. our top priorities are to resolve ongoing  disputes with the european union, canada, and mexico and to make a  global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations  that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. laws  against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international  community must be able to address genuine concerns about government  subsidies and dumping. international industrial espionage which  undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.   * help domestic industries and workers adjust. there is a sound  statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used  in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the  american steel industry. the benefits of free trade depend upon the  enforcement of fair trading practices. these safeguards help ensure that  the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american  workers. trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the  change and dynamism of open markets.   * protect the environment and workers. the united states must foster  economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with  widening prosperity. we will incorporate labor and environmental  concerns into u.s. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network"  between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto, and use the  international labor organization, trade preference programs, and trade  talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.   * enhance energy security. we will strengthen our own energy security  and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our  allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and  types of global energy supplied, especially in the western hemisphere,  africa, central asia, and the caspian region. we will also continue to  work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient  technologies.    economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize  greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing  them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the  global climate. our overall objective is to reduce america's greenhouse  gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such  emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10  years, by the year 2012. our strategies for attaining this goal will be  to:   * remain committed to the basic u.n. framework convention for  international cooperation;   * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of  the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to  companies that can show real cuts;   * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission  reductions;   * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as  well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,  while also improving fuel economy for u.s. cars and trucks;   * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to  a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change  by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's  budget; and   * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas  emitters such as china and india, so that they will have the tools and  resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and  better path.    vii. expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy    "in world war ii we fought to make the world safer, then worked to  rebuild it. as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we  must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."       president bush  washington, d.c. (inter-american  development bank)  march 14, 2002     a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human  race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. including  all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and  opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of  u.s. international policy.   decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic  growth in the poorest countries. worse, development aid has often served  to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and  perpetuating misery. results of aid are typically measured in dollars  spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction  achieved by recipients. these are the indicators of a failed strategy.   working with other nations, the united states is confronting this  failure. we forged a new consensus at the u.n. conference on financing  for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and  the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.   this administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential  of individuals in all nations. sustained growth and poverty reduction is  impossible without the right national policies. where governments have  implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels  of assistance. the united states and other developed countries should  set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's  poorest economies within a decade.   the united states government will pursue these major strategies to  achieve this goal:   * provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of  national reform. we propose a 50 percent increase in the core  development assistance given by the united states. while continuing our  present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,  these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge  account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest  in their people, and encourage economic freedom. governments must fight  corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest  in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and  enable entrepreneurship. the millennium challenge account will reward  countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those  that have not to implement reforms.   * improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development  banks in raising living standards. the united states is committed to a  comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other  multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of  the world's poor. we have reversed the downward trend in u.s.  contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the u.s.  contributions to the international development association (ida) -- the  world bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the african  development fund. the key to raising living standards and reducing  poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially  in the poorest countries. we will continue to press the multilateral  development banks to focus on activities that increase economic  productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,  and private sector development. every project, every loan, every grant  must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in  developing countries.   * insist upon measurable results to ensure that development  assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's  poor. when it comes to economic development, what really matters is that  more children are getting a better education, more people have access to  health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a  better future for their families. we have a moral obligation to measure  the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering  results. for this reason, we will continue to demand that our own  development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral  development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for  achieving those goals. thanks to u.s. leadership, the recent ida  replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation  system that measures recipient countries' progress. for the first time,  donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the  achievement of actual development results, and part of the u.s.  contribution is linked in this way. we will strive to make sure that the  world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this  progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything  that these institutions do.   * increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in  the form of grants instead of loans. greater use of results-based grants  is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,  particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with  ever-larger debt burdens. as a result of u.s. leadership, the recent ida  agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the  poorest countries for education, hiv/aids, health, nutrition, water,  sanitation, and other human needs. our goal is to build on that progress  by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development  banks. we will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private  sector to match government efforts by using grants to support  development projects that show results.   * open societies to commerce and investment. trade and investment are  the real engines of economic growth. even if government aid increases,  most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and  foreign investment. an effective strategy must try to expand these flows  as well. free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national  security strategy.   * secure public health. the scale of the public health crisis in poor  countries is enormous. in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics  like hiv/aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be  threatened until these scourges can be contained. resources from the  developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest  governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective  local infrastructure. the united states has strongly backed the new  global fund for hiv/aids organized by u.n. secretary general kofi annan  and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for  treatment and care. the united states already contributes more than  twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. if the  global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.   * emphasize education. literacy and learning are the foundation of  democracy and development. only about 7 percent of world bank resources  are devoted to education. this proportion should grow. the united states  will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher  training in africa. the united states can also bring information  technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been  devastated by aids.   * continue to aid agricultural development. new technologies,  including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields  in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.  using sound science, the united states should help bring these benefits  to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still  suffer from hunger and malnutrition.    viii. develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers  of global power    "we have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th  century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead  of prepare for war."       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as  broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance  of power that favors freedom. effective coalition leadership requires  clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent  consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.   there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can  accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies  and friends in canada and europe. europe is also the seat of two of the  strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the  north atlantic treaty organization (nato), which has, since its  inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-european  security, and the european union (eu), our partner in opening world  trade.   the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato, as nato itself  recognized when it invoked its article v self-defense clause for the  first time. nato's core mission -- collective defense of the  transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but nato must develop  new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new  circumstances. nato must build a capability to field, at short notice,  highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to  respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.   the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,  creating coalitions under nato's own mandate, as well as contributing to  mission-based coalitions. to achieve this, we must:   * expand nato's membership to those democratic nations willing and  able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;   * ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate  combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;   * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become  effective multinational fighting forces;   * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of  scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that  they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;   * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to  meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of  training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;  and   * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as  we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.    if nato succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a  partnership as central to the security and interests of its member  states as was the case during the cold war. we will sustain a common  perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to  take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. at the  same time, we welcome our european allies' efforts to forge a greater  foreign policy and defense identity with the eu, and commit ourselves to  close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato. we  cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of  transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.   the attacks of september 11 energized america's asian alliances.  australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an  attack on australia itself, following that historic decision with the  dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for operation  enduring freedom. japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented  levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist  attack. we have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our  alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received  invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand.   the war against terrorism has proven that america's alliances in asia  not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and  ready to deal with new challenges. to enhance our asian alliances and  friendships, we will:    * look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and  global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our  close defense and diplomatic cooperation;   * work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while  preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of  the region over the longer-term;   * build on 50 years of u.s.-australian alliance cooperation as we  continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as  we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora;   * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our  allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic  environment; and   * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with  institutions such as asean and the asia-pacific economic cooperation  forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage  change in this dynamic region.    we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power  competition. several potential great powers are now in the midst of  internal transition -- most importantly russia, india, and china. in all  three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly  global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.   with russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based  on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the united states and  russia are no longer strategic adversaries. the moscow treaty on  strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a  critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,  long-term relations with the euro-atlantic community and the united  states. russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their  country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --  needed to reverse those weaknesses. they understand, increasingly, that  cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that  russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas.   united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to  refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and  challenges. we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the  global war on terrorism. we are facilitating russia's entry into the  world trade organization, without lowering standards for accession, to  promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. we have  created the nato-russia council with the goal of deepening security  cooperation among russia, our european allies, and ourselves. we will  continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the  former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable  neighborhood will reinforce russia's growing commitment to integration  into the euro-atlantic community.   at the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still  divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to  build an enduring strategic partnership. lingering distrust of our  motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our  relations. russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market  democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. russia's very  weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. nevertheless, those  opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even  decades.   the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral  relationship with india based on a conviction that u.s. interests  require a strong relationship with india. we are the two largest  democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative  government. india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. we  have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through  the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean. finally, we share an interest  in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia.   differences remain, including over the development of india's nuclear  and missile programs, and the pace of india's economic reforms. but  while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about  india, today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with  which we have common strategic interests. through a strong partnership  with india, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic  future.   the united states relationship with china is an important part of our  strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous asia-pacific  region. we welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous  china. the democratic development of china is crucial to that future.  yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst  features of the communist legacy, china's leaders have not yet made the  next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.  in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its  neighbors in the asia-pacific region, china is following an outdated  path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national  greatness. in time, china will find that social and political freedom is  the only source of that greatness.   the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing  china. we already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including  the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean  peninsula. likewise, we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan  and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and  similar transitional concerns. shared health and environmental threats,  such as the spread of hiv/aids, challenge us to promote jointly the  welfare of our citizens.   addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become  more open with information, promote the development of civil society,  and enhance individual human rights. china has begun to take the road to  political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting  village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national  one-party rule by the communist party. to make that nation truly  accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work  remains to be done. only by allowing the chinese people to think,  assemble, and worship freely can china reach its full potential.   our important trade relationship will benefit from china's entry into  the world trade organization, which will create more export  opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers, workers,  and companies. china is our fourth largest trading partner, with over  $100 billion in annual two-way trade. the power of market principles and  the wto's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance  openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic  protections for commerce and for citizens. there are, however, other  areas in which we have profound disagreements. our commitment to the  self-defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one. human  rights is another. we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation  commitments. we will work to narrow differences where they exist, but  not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.   the events of september 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for  relations between the united states and other main centers of global  power, and opened vast, new opportunities. with our long-standing allies  in europe and asia, and with leaders in russia, india, and china, we  must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships  become routine and unproductive.   every agency of the united states government shares the challenge. we  can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober  analysis, and common action. in the long-term, these are the practices  that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open  the path of progress.   ix. transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century    "terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity. they did not touch  its source. america is successful because of the hard work, creativity,  and enterprise of our people."       president bush  washington, d.c. (joint session of congress)  september 20, 2001     the major institutions of american national security were designed in a  different era to meet different requirements. all of them must be  transformed.   it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength.  we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. our military's  highest priority is to defend the united states. to do so effectively,  our military must:   * assure our allies and friends;   * dissuade future military competition;   * deter threats against u.s. interests, allies, and friends; and   * decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.    the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces, and their  forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most  strategically vital regions. however, the threats and enemies we must  confront have changed, and so must our forces. a military structured to  deter massive cold war-era armies must be transformed to focus more on  how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might  occur. we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational  challenges.   the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound  symbols of the u.s. commitments to allies and friends. through our  willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,  the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of  power that favors freedom. to contend with uncertainty and to meet the  many security challenges we face, the united states will require bases  and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia, as  well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment  of u.s. forces.   before the war in afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major  planning contingencies. yet, in a very short time, we had to operate  across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch  of the armed forces. we must prepare for more such deployments by  developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision  strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.  this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the  ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure  u.s. access to distant theaters, and protect critical u.s.  infrastructure and assets in outer space.   innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new  approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting u.s.  intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and  technology. we must also transform the way the department of defense is  run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.  finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight  the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the president with a  wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of  coercion against the united states, our allies, and our friends.   we know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from  experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. the united states must  and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --  whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the united  states, our allies, or our friends. we will maintain the forces  sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. our forces  will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a  military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the  united states.   intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense  against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. designed  around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,  fixed object -- the soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping  with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of  targets.   we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to  keep pace with the nature of these threats. intelligence must be  appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems  and coordinated with our allies and friends. we need to protect the  capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the  knowledge of how best to surprise us. those who would harm us also seek  the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and  to maximize injury.   we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide  integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. since  the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted  inside the united states, we must also ensure the proper fusion of  information between intelligence and law enforcement.   initiatives in this area will include:   * strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence  to lead the development and actions of the nation's foreign intelligence  capabilities;   * establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides  seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing  the nation and our allies;   * continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to  sustain our intelligence advantage;   * investing in future capabilities while working to protect them  through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence  capabilities; and   * collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the  government with all-source analysis.    as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend  america's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other  nations. we will ensure that the department of state receives funding  sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy. the state  department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with  other governments. and in this new era, its people and institutions must  be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations  and international institutions. officials trained mainly in  international politics must also extend their reach to understand  complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public  health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.   our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil  wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. as humanitarian relief  requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build  police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial  government institutions, and electoral systems. effective international  cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by american  readiness to play our part.   just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out  to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to  public information efforts that can help people around the world learn  about and understand america. the war on terrorism is not a clash of  civilizations. it does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,  a battle for the future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas  and this is an area where america must excel.   we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet  our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired  by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the  international criminal court (icc), whose jurisdiction does not extend  to americans and which we do not accept. we will work together with  other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and  cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral  agreements that will protect u.s. nationals from the icc. we will  implement fully the american servicemembers protection act, whose  provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u.s.  personnel and officials.   we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the  right level and allocation of government spending on national security.  the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this  war. at home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for  the american people.   today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is  diminishing. in a globalized world, events beyond america's borders have  a greater impact inside them. our society must be open to people, ideas,  and goods from across the globe. the characteristics we most cherish --  our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are  vulnerable to terrorism. this vulnerability will persist long after we  bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks.  as time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that  until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. this  is a new condition of life. we will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite  of it.   in exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and  interests of our friends and partners. still, we will be prepared to act  apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. when we  disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for  our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. we will not allow  such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with  our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.   ultimately, the foundation of american strength is at home. it is in the  skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of  our institutions. a diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,  entrepreneurial energy. our strength comes from what we do with that  energy. that is where our national security begins.    
easy_ham,weird... i never thought the govmint would get into funding this. you know 'weapons of mass destruction'. etc. etc.  == http://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121  september 20, 2002 senate committee passes nanotech bill by roy mark  the senate commerce committee unanimously passed on thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development. introduced by sen. ron wyden (d-ore.), the 21st century nanotechnology research and development act would create the national nanotechnology research program. the bill is co-sponsored by sen. joe lieberman (d-conn.) and sen. george allen (r-va.).  the proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals.  "the unanimous support of the senate commerce committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology," lieberman, who vowed to pushed to full senate passage before the end of the year, said. "nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology. the u.s. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology. our legislation will provide the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."  the bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the national science and technology council. it would also create a presidential national nanotechnology advisory panel and national nanotechnology coordination office, which would provide administrative and technical support for the advisory panel and the council.  "my own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change america on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. i am determined that the united states will not miss, but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology," wyden said in introducing the bill. "at present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a half-dozen federal agencies. i want america to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. and i believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal.  to study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new center for societal, ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues related to nanotechnology would also be established.  according to lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the national research council (nrc), which completed a thorough review of the national nanotechnology initiative in june.  those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel; emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities, equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals.    
easy_ham, related to the ms acquisition of xdegrees?  == http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271  sun nabs storage startup by clint boulton amid the flurry of news at its own sunnetwork 2002 conference in san francisco, sun microsystems thursday said it has agreed to purchase data storage concern pirus networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.  the palo alto, calif. networking firm bought the acton, mass.-based startup with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and virtualization technology. used as part of a storage area network (define), virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console.  though major vendors make similar technology, pirus competes with the likes of rhapsody networks and confluence networks. sun plucked pirus after scouting some 65 companies.  mark lovington, vice president of marketing for pirus, told internetnews.com that pirus and sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible acquisition. pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such as sun ibm, hp, hitachi.  "this is a huge opportunity for pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7 or 8 system-level players," lovington said. "sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their n1 initiative. the synergies were quite obvious."  n1 is sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define) architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a role in a computation problem or information processing. n1 is being styled as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.  while lagging behind other, more entrenched players, sun is gaining ground in the storage market with its sun storedge complete storage solutions, according to a new report by idc. john mcarthur, group vice president of idc's storage program, said sun microsystems and ibm posted the largest increases in total storage revenue over q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains, respectively. as of q2, sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of $411 million.  sun's acquisition of pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends december 29, 2002.

easy_ham,  anarchist 'scavenger hunt' raises d.c. police ire sat sep 21, 3:37 pm et  washington (reuters) - an online "anarchist scavenger hunt" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the international monetary fund ( news - web sites) and world bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire of police, who fear demonstrators could damage property and wreak havoc.  break a mcdonald's window, get 300 points. puncture a washington d.c. police car tire to win 75 points. score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive or world bank delegate.  d.c. assistant police chief terrance gainer told a congressional hearing on friday that law authorities were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, "so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to take proactive action."  several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the imf and world bank headquarters next weekend.  the anti-capitalist convergence, a d.c.-based anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the downtown core.  chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name, told reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.  "people were asking for things to do when they come to d.c. we made the list to get people thinking, so they don't do the boring, standard stuff," he said. "i doubt people will actually keep track of what they do for points."

easy_ham,oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.  but the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the american colonies.  and, btw, england as well.  dear ben franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  first of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to england proper.  second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.  (in fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  it sounds like a modern keynsian was creating an urban legend.)  otoh the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling.  imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou.  ===========================  the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money.  the effects are a complete disaster.  there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.  so almost all the literature talks about that.  but you can also screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation.  the fundamental cause of the american great depression was exactly this, courtesy of the federal reserve board.  i don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of canada had much effect.  and canada is still a prosperous country.      -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of gary  lawrence murphy  sent: saturday, september 21, 2002 7:31 am  to: mr. fork  cc: fork@example.com  subject: re: sed /s/united states/roman empire/g     "f" == fork list  writes:        f "free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift      f whole societies out of poverty" i'm not a      f socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear      f examples?    china?  ooops, no wait, scratch that.    there is one counter example that i can think of, but it may not be  precisely "free trade/markets" -- when ben franklin first visited  england he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  ben  explained that they used "colonial script", a kind of barter-dollar,  and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  the  british bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to  clamp down on the practice.  within a few years, the colonies were  rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the empire.    according to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political  party here in canada, the founding fathers had no real complaint about  tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were  protesting. if this is true, then it comes right back to the forces  that killed ned ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes  they were protesting a tea tax.  the same pamphlet claimed that canada  was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the  late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the  juristiction of parliament and handed over to the bank of canada.    i've wondered about all this.  certainly the timeline of the collapse  of the canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of  other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300m people when  we only had 20m) anyone have any further information on this?    --  gary lawrence murphy - garym@teledyn.com - teledynamics communications   - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -    "computers are useless. they can only give you answers."

[given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]   the *next* category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a "terminal" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible.  why? because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof.  meritocracy, american style, was *invented* at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? :-). practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids *still* had to get the grades, and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.   the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.  btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *i* went to missouri, and *i* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a "terminal" one, which means *i*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort.  [i will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.]    btw, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country, *including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have *more* money, and there would be *more* self-made people on that list. in addition, most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have *much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency and not "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.  that efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time...   in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.  to believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto -- romantic nonsense.  cheers, rah  -----begin pgp signature----- version: pgp 7.5  iqa/awubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yyboc+icylp5tlkl58jpwefu =z877 -----end pgp signature-----  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'

"the idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement," christy said. "if satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."  the 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees celsius (about 0.28  fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees celsius (about 0.23  fahrenheit) per decade.  globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees celsius per decade since the first noaa tiros-n satellites went into service.  "these 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet," christy said. "they are not representative of the total globe."  radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time. as each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.  while there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. these 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by iceland, trinidad, truk island and alaska.  in an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by noaa from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05  c per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, christy said.    global coverage  one advantage of the msu dataset is its global coverage. microwave sounding units aboard noaa satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. each satellite measures the temperature above most points on earth every 12 hours.  the 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. it neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including antarctica, the brazilian rain forests, the sahara desert and greenland.  the most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. more than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.  most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. in the u.s. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.  the ground-based network is extensive in north america, europe, russia, china and japan. it is less comprehensive in africa, south america, australia and across much of southern asia.  temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time.  while balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. if they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the earth's surface.  water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard "ships of opportunity." the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. the water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.  in the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.    instrument accuracy; msu  with nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.  each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.  because the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. the final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)  to check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.    instrument accuracy; ground-based thermometers  of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. this temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.    instrument accuracy; ships of opportunity  while the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.  the thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.  only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.    the scientists  in 1996, spencer and christy received the american meteorological society's special award. they were honored "for developing a global, precise record of the earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."  ams special awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.  in 1991, spencer and christy received nasa's exceptional scientific achievement medal.    dr. john christy  christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at uah in 1987, after earning his b.a.

easy_ham,http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23herb.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top   the new york times september 23, 2002 high-altitude rambos by bob herbert  dr. bob rajcoomar, a u.s. citizen and former military physician from lake worth, fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the u.s. since the sept. 11 attacks.  dr. rajcoomar was seated in first class on a delta airlines flight from atlanta to philadelphia on aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. the passenger, steven feuer, had nothing to do with dr. rajcoomar.  two u.s. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront mr. feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. what ensued was terrifying. when mr. feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in hollywood's latest action extravaganza.  they handcuffed mr. feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to dr. rajcoomar. the 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. dr. rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. the incident, already scary, could - and should - have ended there. but the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  one of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. the marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. they barked a series of orders. no one should stand for any reason. arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. no one should try to visit the restroom. the message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  the passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  "i was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin," said senior judge james a. lineberger of the philadelphia court of common pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. "i was afraid that i was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."  dr. rajcoomar's wife, dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, "it was really like rambo in the air." she worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak english, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. if someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  there were no terrorists on board. there was no threat of any kind. when the plane landed about half an hour later, mr. feuer was taken into custody. and then, shockingly, so was dr. rajcoomar. the air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  this was airline security gone berserk. no one ever suggested that dr. rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired army major, had done anything wrong.  dr. rajcoomar, who is of indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. he was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. mr. feuer was also released.  officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a philadelphia inquirer reporter as shawn b. mccullers and samuel mumma of the transportation security administration, which is part of the u.s. transportation department.  the transportation security administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. a spokesman offered the absurd explanation that dr. rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too closely."  if that becomes a criterion for arrest in the u.s., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  dr. rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "i had never been treated like that in my life," he said. "i was afraid that i was about to be beaten up or killed."  lawyers for the american civil liberties union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  "we have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security," said dr. rajcoomar. "so many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security."  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'   
easy_ham,http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,sb10327475102363433,00.html   the wall street journal  september 23, 2002 commentary  rebuild at ground zero  by larry silverstein  earlier this month, we new yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept. 11, 2001. all of those who perished must never be forgotten. the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us.  but for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site.  about 50,000 people worked in the world trade center. those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. together, those jobs in lower manhattan, for which the trade center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. new york city is facing a budget deficit. without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.  if we do not replace the lost space, lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. love them or hate them, and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue, the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said, "this is new york, a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life." that is why they were destroyed. this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.  in recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. most of these focus not on the trade center site, however, but on all of lower manhattan. further, many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or simply never rebuilt.  these proposals miss the point. what was destroyed, and what must be recovered, was the trade center, not all of lower manhattan. except over the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.  access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 9/11. none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned, such as the new fulton transit center and the direct "train-to-the-plane" long island rail road connection, the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development.  and new york will need the space. before 9/11, the group of 35, a task force of civic leaders led by sen. charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need.  as for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, i would simply point out that history shows them wrong. new york now has about 400 million square feet of office space. all new construction underway already is substantially leased up. new york had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. by 1998, this space had been absorbed, at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.  we are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s' rate.  those who argue that new york cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. i will not accept this view, nor will most new yorkers.  mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city "has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the future." i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate -- and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area.  the challenge to accomplish this is enormous. but our city is up to the task.  mr. silverstein is president of silverstein properties, a real estate firm whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the world trade center site.  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "...

[given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of *those* on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]   the *next* category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a "terminal" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible.  why? because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof.     i, at on point, looked into stanford business school. after learning  that tuition was  20k, no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this  smart person decided that i was not willing to spend the $150 application fee  (non-refundable). during attendance at my local business school, i was told repeatedly i should have gone for  it - to quote a prof, (northwestern mba), it has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general european  (and canadian) business schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. he used  the words "american nobility."  meritocracy, american style, was *invented* at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? :-). practically *nobody* who goes to a top-20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids *still* had to get the grades, and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.     "invented" being the right word. dubya went to yale and hbs. i guess  "practically" gets you around that problem.   the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal" degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is* smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.  btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *i* went to missouri, and *i* don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a "terminal" one, which means *i*'m broker than anyone on this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zero-sum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort.  [i will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you, apparently.]      its interesting but in this part of the world (nova scotia) a recent  study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools).  they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in. just for the record -  the average salary for a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is c$  21,000  -- stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time...     much as i like to accept what you say - i do believe in free markets , i  have difficulty finding any - except of course for labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well  unless the supply is tight) it was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the  self-made billionaires on the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the  concept of "more stuff, cheaper" which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. a particularly  galling example is high-speed internet access. an article i read a couple of years ago that  it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the  telecom industry (maintain your monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through  the same regulators) meet. sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. the whole  entertainment industry/riaa/palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer  seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to  produce profits for the favored few.   in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.  to believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto -- romantic nonsense.     i usually agree - but when there's a republican in office -  i feel like  they're the biggest believers in the manifesto, in reverse. create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the  rights of that "proletariat" you've just created with bogus "law and order" policies , concentrate capital  in the hands of a few (ideally people who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. oh,  and lie - use the word "compassionate" a lot. i guess i tend to believe that a certain  amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the  republic party seems to be the more homeless under  each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.  and the facts are, for most people in the western world  are declining  standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net, greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the  work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right  to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining  standards of living) is the reality.  again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep coming back to -  the cia world factbook - on the us economy:  "since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to  the top 20% of households"  owen

easy_ham,"the historical record", by which you mean *human* historical record, is highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.  my problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last 50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change.  people unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  i therefore  immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological standards).  this is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda.  it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization.  the receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years.  i don't see any compelling reason to "save the glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient.  for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  i'll just stick with occam's razor for now.  in my humble opinion.  cheers,  -james rogers  jamesr@best.com   on mon, 2002-09-23 at 12:23, jim whitehead wrote:    for anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the  dramatic increase in co2 concentrations are not increasing the global  temperature. they would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are  melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. that is,  people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate  explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).    
easy_ham, for anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the greens.  a green once said that if the spotted owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it.  so it is with global warming.  their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization.  the fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news.  the news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement.  rather than have to defend co2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in co2 need a good explanation of the "medieval warm period".  said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by co2.  in point of fact the predicted global warming due to co2 is not caused directly by co2.  co2 doesn't trap that much heat.  water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to co2 then you have your warming theory.  yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.  more water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds.  clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.  a good link is: http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?pid=2051-100&cid=2051- 060302a    -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of jim  whitehead  sent: monday, september 23, 2002 12:23 pm  to: robert harley; fork@example.com  subject: re: goodbye global warming     gary lawrence murphy wrote:   and say hello to the cool:  oooo ... /this/ is going to cause   some stir ...     of course not.  some people just don't want to be confused by the facts.    for anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why  the  dramatic increase in co2 concentrations are not increasing the global  temperature. they would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are  melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. that  is,  people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate  explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).    - jim

easy_ham, "the historical record", by which you mean *human* historical record, is  highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological  timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.  there has been a significant recent increase in global co2 concentrations. the vast preponderance of the new co2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of europe, and accelerating after wwii. most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased co2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming. hence our interest in items of human time scale.   it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited  during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of  humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers  paved over their civilization.  the receding glaciers have turned into a  bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried  in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the  ice for thousands of years.  i don't see any compelling reason to "save  the glaciers" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their  existence has always been transient.  most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today. the point of global warming isn't to save the earth -- the planet is not sentient. the point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity.   for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are  anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  i'll  just stick with occam's razor for now.  the increase in atmospheric co2 concentration is due to human activity.  it is generally accepted that increases in co2 in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. this is the current best explanation for the high temperature of venus. if the co2 concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy. this process may be slow, and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. i encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking co2 to eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident as heat.  - jim

easy_ham,i've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years.  i've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason.  here is a recent article from u.s. news that i actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.  -james rogers  jamesr@best.com   -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm  defrosting the past  ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming world  by alex markels  as he hiked near colorado's continental divide in the summer of 2001, ed knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. "it looked like a bison skull," the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. "i thought, 'that's strange. bison don't live this high up.' "  knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about 340 years ago. "this was an extraordinary discovery," says russ graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "there's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."  and not just bison. colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. as the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. the fabrics, wood, bone, and dna-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.  "it's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains," says johan reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the national geographic society. rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "ice man," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.  vanishing act. the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first. once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient.  that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia, canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. "it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice," recalls warren ward, a teacher from nearby nelson. "but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."  figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip-loc bag and delivered them to local officials. archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. dubbed kwaday dan ts'inchi, or long ago person found, by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in north america.  other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. "before this there was no archaeological record of people living here," says greg hare, a yukon government archaeologist. "now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."  like ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, gerry kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south yukon. they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. "it was really odd, because i knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government.  caribou cake. returning a week later, he found "what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it." it turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices.  scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. hunters followed the game. they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. "we've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago," says hare, who now oversees the research project.

easy_ham,[a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows, along with the  article i was commenting on... rohit]  in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week ("the  search goes on", sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most  subversive aspect of google's service is not its card catalog, which  merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. by  maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web,  if you can get to google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.  the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce  these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from  google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. almost all  web browsers, however, include support for secure sockets layer (ssl)  encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. upgrading to  ssl makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;  censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in  china. the only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of  ip addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in  the article.  of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic  costs real money. if the united states is so concerned about the free  flow of information, why shouldn't the broadcasting board of governors  sponsor an encrypted interface to google, or for that matter, the rest  of the web?  to date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector  programming for the voice of america, radio sawa, and the like. just  imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure  access to private-sector media instead. nothing illustrates the freedom  of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most  of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project.  on second thought, i can hardly imagine this administration *promoting*  the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. never mind...  best,    rohit khare  ===========================================================  the search goes on china backtracks on banning google up to a point  sep 19th 2002 | beijing  from the economist print edition  in chinese, the nickname for google, an american internet search engine,  is gougou, meaning  doggy . for the country's fast-growing population of  internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving  an elusive creature. earlier this month, the chinese authorities blocked  access to google from internet service providers in china apparently  because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to  forbidden sites. now, after an outcry from those users, access has been  restored.  an unusual climbdown by china's zealous internet censors? hardly. more  sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to  use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.  access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by  google as it trawls the internet. these once provided a handy way for  chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.  after the blocking of google on august 31st, many chinese internet users  posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move.  their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet  providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site  to far less powerful search engines in china.  duncan clark, the head of a beijing-based technology consultancy firm,  bda (china) ltd, says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to  censor the internet. until recently, it had focused on blocking  individual sites, including all pages stored on them. now it seems to be  filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key  words that might indicate undesirable content. for example earlier this  week when using eastnet, a beijing-based internet provider, a search on  google for falun gong a quasi-buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china  usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. such a search  also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes.   
easy_ham,  how about this:   a bored forker said:  "yawn"  i believe tom had it right.   signal not noise.  i'll start:                 los angeles times september 23, 2002 monday                    copyright 2002 / los angeles times                             los angeles times  september 23, 2002 monday  home edition section: main news main news; part 1; page 13; national desk length: 1013 words byline: dana calvo, times staff writer dateline: seattle  body:  the idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a public-policy think tank here.  the challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. staring into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an unlikely solution: put a tax--just a "benign" dime a shot--on espresso.  that led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 seattle residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one that taps right into seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. this is, after all, the town where starbucks was born and where the $12 pound of beans became a staple. there is one starbucks for every 7,000 residents in seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in new york. seattle also has two other major coffee chains, tully's coffee and seattle's best coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.  a recent poll showed that 74% of seattle residents would vote for the tax. "for people outside of seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy," said john burbank, the think tank's executive director, "but it was common sense."  research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.  burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. city council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.  burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. the think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.  burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs made earlier this year by gov. gary locke. he also says it would provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.  at bauhaus books & coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.  espresso lovers like chris altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. "i'm ok with it," said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. "the money's got to come from somewhere."  hope revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading "zen and the art of pottery." she supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers: they want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.  some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.  david marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. "i, for one, don't have kids, but i drink espresso," he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. "i don't mind paying, but i think everyone should pay."  coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as jolt--joined to oppose the latte tax. among the members are seattle's chamber of commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, starbucks and tully's.  the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. if espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit.  university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn't add up.   "the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither," he said. "on the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. for example, starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. would they be right? i don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care.  "of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and i mean that in a cynical way. they've pitted espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?"  in fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. in a liberal city like seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.  "starbucks will continue to support early-learning and childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually," the company said. "however, starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product."  the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. the initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. drip coffee would be exempt.  burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. so, he's been pitching it as a modern-day robin hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.  it's the kind of political marketing that fran beulah, 43, finds funny. "i drink espresso," she said, laughing, "and i am not rich."     jh "i did not have sex with that woman."   -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of jh mr.  fork  sent: monday, september 23, 2002 2:12 pm  to: fork  subject: re: goodbye global warming      ----- original message -----  from: "john hall"      a green once said that if the spotted owl hadn't existed they   would have had to invent it.  a republican once said "i am not a crook".      --  best regards,  bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows, along with the article i was commenting on... rohit]  in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week ("the search goes on", sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web, if you can get to google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.  the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. almost all web browsers, however, include support for secure sockets layer (ssl) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china. the only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of ip addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article.  of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google, or for that matter, the rest of the web?  to date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the voice of america, radio sawa, and the like. just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project.  on second thought, i can hardly imagine this administration *promoting* the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. never mind...  best,    rohit khare  ===========================================================  the search goes on china backtracks on banning google up to a point  sep 19th 2002 | beijing  from the economist print edition  in chinese, the nickname for google, an american internet search engine, is gougou, meaning  doggy . for the country's fast-growing population of internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. earlier this month, the chinese authorities blocked access to google from internet service providers in china apparently because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored.  an unusual climbdown by china's zealous internet censors? hardly. more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet. these once provided a handy way for chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.  after the blocking of google on august 31st, many chinese internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move. their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site to far less powerful search engines in china.  duncan clark, the head of a beijing-based technology consultancy firm, bda (china) ltd, says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the internet. until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. for example earlier this week when using eastnet, a beijing-based internet provider, a search on google for falun gong a quasi-buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china  usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. such a search also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes.    
easy_ham,anyone who doesn't appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation.  america has, in fact, moved hard toward meritocracy.  but -- and this is a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the forbes list.  there is an element of luck, even if only being in the right place at the right time, to go that high.  beyond the forbes list, there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth.  being a super-model, for example. though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models. cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school.  most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  it is the rest of us who tend to sort.  there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place.  rawls claims merit doesn't exist.  sowell seems to agree at least in part, but i'm sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.  and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  iq?  purity of heart?  or the ability to satisfy customers?  functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart.  yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.  differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck.  luck can be forgiven. superior performance, often not.    -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of geege  schuman  sent: monday, september 23, 2002 4:44 pm  to: r. a. hettinga; geege schuman; owen byrne  cc: gary lawrence murphy; mr. fork; fork@example.com; digital bearer  settlement list  subject: re: comrade communism (was re: crony capitalism (was re: sed  /s/united states/roman empire/g))    first, misattribution.  i did not write the blurb below.  i made one  statement about vp cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.    i couldn't agree with you more on this: "in short, then, economics is not  a  zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the  backs  of the poor, and redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit  is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise," however, i resent being  lumped  in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich  and  successful at face value is apropos of nothing and i am beginning to  understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad  hominem (re cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like "if rich then  deservedly" or "if rich then smarter."  given that, i am also beginning to  understand why some people need to be rich.    wrt to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  wrt harvard: over 90% of  2002 graduates were cum laude +. interesting curve.  those eager to be  measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide  the balast.    speaking of forbes, was reading about peter norton just today in an old  issue while waiting for my doctor.  norton attributes his success to luck.  imagine.    geege    -----original message-----  from: r. a. hettinga [mailto:rah@shipwright.com]  sent: sunday, september 22, 2002 10:01 pm  to: geege schuman; owen byrne  cc: gary lawrence murphy; mr. fork; fork@example.com; digital bearer  settlement list  subject: comrade communism (was re: crony capitalism (was re: sed  /s/united states/roman empire/g))      -----begin pgp signed message-----  hash: sha1    at 11:15 am -0400 on 9/22/02, geege schuman wrote:       most of them seem to have ivy league educations, or are ivy league   dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start   with.    actually, if i remember correctly from discussion of the list's  composition in forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to  get on the forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. can you say  "bootstraps", boys and girls? i knew you could...

easy_ham,thanks for the link - i'm fascinated by archaeology as well.  ----- original message ----- from: "james rogers"  to:  sent: monday, september 23, 2002 2:48 pm subject: re: goodbye global warming   i've seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years.  i've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason.  here is a recent article from u.s. news that i actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.  -james rogers  jamesr@best.com   -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm  defrosting the past  ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming world  by alex markels  as he hiked near colorado's continental divide in the summer of 2001, ed knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. "it looked like a bison skull," the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. "i thought, 'that's strange. bison don't live this high up.' "  knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about 340 years ago. "this was an extraordinary discovery," says russ graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "there's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."  and not just bison. colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. as the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. the fabrics, wood, bone, and dna-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.  "it's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains," says johan reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the national geographic society. rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "ice man," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.  vanishing act. the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first. once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient.  that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia, canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. "it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice," recalls warren ward, a teacher from nearby nelson. "but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."  figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip-loc bag and delivered them to local officials. archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. dubbed kwaday dan ts'inchi, or long ago person found, by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in north america.  other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. "before this there was no archaeological record of people living here," says greg hare, a yukon government archaeologist. "now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."  like ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, gerry kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south yukon. they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. "it was really odd, because i knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government.  caribou cake. returning a week later, he found "what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it." it turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices.  scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. hunters followed the game. they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. "we've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago," says hare, who now oversees the research project. "then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. and by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts."  now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska's wrangell and st. elias mountain ranges the united states' most glaciated terrain and in the andes. johan reinhard thinks the fast- thawing european alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the ice man. "global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. we're probably about the only ones happy about it."

easy_ham,depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation.  the biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. it also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly.  rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing.  as for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, i find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  the opinion that either we are spending too much or we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics.  finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself.  and in my experience people who label themselves 'green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon.      -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of geege  schuman    funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally  irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment -  overregulation  or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the  neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of "liberal" as "one who seeks  to  impose both."

easy_ham,from slate's "today's papers":   the new york times and los angeles times both lead with word that a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest national gas pipeline company, el paso, illegally withheld gas from the market during california's energy squeeze in 2000-01. the judge concluded that el paso left 21 percent of its capacity in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and helping to induce rolling blackouts.   and this is the product of overregulation?  -----original message----- from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com]on behalf of john hall sent: monday, september 23, 2002 11:57 pm to: fork subject: liberal defnitions   depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over regulation.  the biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible. it also has the ability to single out particular people, while over spending spreads the damage more evenly.  rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing.  as for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both, i find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  the opinion that either we are spending too much or we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics.  finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private replacements, no government regulation) is better than government regulation itself.  and in my experience people who label themselves 'green' (which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a watermelon.      -----original message-----  from: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] on behalf of geege  schuman    funny. i read it as green = red, as in accounting, as in fiscally  irresponsible.  which do you think is the worse indictment -  overregulation  or overspending?  there are many (dickheads) who buy into the  neo-conservative media's (fox's) definiton of "liberal" as "one who seeks  to  impose both."

easy_ham,http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_fact1  the new yorker  the next world order by nicholas lemann the bush administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power. issue of 2002-04-01 posted 2002-03-25  when there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected. this feeling seems especially intense in the bush administration, perhaps because bill clinton has been bracketed by a father-son team. it's easy for people in the administration to believe that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the bush family has resumed its governance-and about time, too.  the bush administration's sense that the clinton years were a waste, or worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs. republicans tend to regard democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline. condoleezza rice, bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in foreign affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused clinton of "an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief." most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this administration also served under the president's father. they took office last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting by clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.  not long ago, i had lunch with-sorry!-a senior administration foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in washington called the oval room. early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose cover bore the seal of the department of defense, an outline map of the world, and these words:  defense strategy for the 1990s: the regional defense strategy secretary of defense dick cheney january 1993  one of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is communicating its drama. actors, professional athletes, and even elected politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform publicly. people who have titles like deputy assistant secretary of defense are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard, and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. how, possibly, to explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing carnegie hall?  after the fall of the berlin wall, dick cheney, then the secretary of defense, set up a "shop," as they say, to think about american foreign policy after the cold war, at the grand strategic level. the project, whose existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at a higher level: among them, paul wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense; lewis libby, cheney's chief of staff; and eric edelman, a senior foreign-policy adviser to cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and intellectually bolder than most other people in washington. (donald rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, shares these characteristics, and has been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years.) colin powell, then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, mounted a competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine american foreign policy and defense. a date was set-may 21, 1990-on which each team would brief cheney for an hour; cheney would then brief president bush, after which bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the new grand strategy.  everybody worked for months on the "five-twenty-one brief," with a sense that the shape of the post-cold war world was at stake. when wolfowitz and powell arrived at cheney's office on may 21st, wolfowitz went first, but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and cheney (a hawk who, perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. powell didn't get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in the world until a couple of weeks later. cheney briefed president bush, using material mostly from wolfowitz, and bush prepared his major foreign-policy address. but he delivered it on august 2, 1990, the day that iraq invaded kuwait, so nobody noticed.  the team kept working. in 1992, the times got its hands on a version of the material, and published a front-page story saying that the pentagon envisioned a future in which the united states could, and should, prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. a few weeks of controversy ensued about the bush administration's hawks being "unilateral"-controversy that cheney's people put an end to with denials and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.  as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton, the cheney team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. the report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before clinton took office. it is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a "scrubbed," meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the essential ideas of "shaping," rather than reacting to, the rest of the world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. a more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled "from containment to global leadership?," which zalmay khalilzad, who joined cheney's team in 1991 and is now special envoy to afghanistan, published a couple of years into the clinton administration, when he was out of government. it recommends that the united states "preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future." khalilzad writes, "it is a vital u.s. interest to preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose."  when george w. bush was campaigning for president, he and the people around him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of the policy of containment of the soviet union's sphere of influence which the united states maintained during the cold war. in his first major foreign-policy speech, delivered in november of 1999, bush declared that "a president must be a clear-eyed realist," a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. "realism" is exactly the foreign-policy doctrine that cheney's pentagon team rejected, partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating world affairs for any length of time.  one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of september 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking. any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what bush has done so far-made war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic security. it is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly entering the realm of presidential choice, and all indications are that bush is going to use september 11th as the occasion to launch a new, aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. all his rhetoric, especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress since september 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging, because it enhances bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking.  inside government, the reason september 11th appears to have been "a transformative moment," as the senior official i had lunch with put it, is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american public's usual resistance to american military involvement overseas, at least for a while. the clinton administration, beginning with the "black hawk down" operation in mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing kosovo operation, in clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign military adventure. now that the united states has been attacked, the options are much broader. the senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999 study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies, which argued that the "mass public" is much less casualty-averse than the military or the civilian  lite believes; for example, the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (the american death total in the vietnam war was about fifty-eight thousand.) september 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.  recently, i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice. rice's foreign affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: "the united states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest' in the absence of soviet power." i asked her whether that is still the case. "i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role," she said immediately. "i think september 11th was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen. events are in much sharper relief." like bush, she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction "in the hands of irresponsible states" now define the national interest. (the latter goal, by the way, is new-in bush's speech to congress on september 20th, america's sole grand purpose was ending terrorism.) we talked in her west wing office; its tall windows face the part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their standups. in her bearing, rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public. she looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm, rather than belligerence.  in the foreign affairs article, rice came across as a classic realist, putting forth "the notions of power politics, great powers, and power balances" as the proper central concerns of the united states. now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that cheney's pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the united states, because of the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. "theoretically, the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it," rice said. "and i think what you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to productive and co perative relations with the united states, rather than to try to balance the united states. i actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out. it's not all foreordained."  rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the national security council and asked them to think seriously about "how do you capitalize on these opportunities" to fundamentally change american doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of september 11th. "i really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947," she said-that is, the period when the containment doctrine took shape-"in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition. that has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics. and it's important to try to seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again."  the national security council is legally required to produce an annual document called the national security strategy, stating the over-all goals of american policy-another government report whose importance is great but not obvious. the bush administration did not produce one last year, as the clinton administration did not in its first year. rice said that she is working on the report now.  "there are two ways to handle this document," she told me. "one is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. but it's our view that, since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration, it's important. an awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior to 9/11. i can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but i would think sometime this spring. and it's important that it be a real statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction that it's going."  it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. some questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being asked, are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. the leak a couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture, adding offensive capability against "rogue states," departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. is the united states now in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the middle east, and replacing governments by force? nobody thought that the bush administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago.  just before the 2000 election, a republican foreign-policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a bush administration's direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, paul wolfowitz or richard haass. haass is another veteran of the first bush administration, and an intellectual like wolfowitz, but much more moderate. in 1997, he published a book titled "the reluctant sheriff," in which he poked a little fun at wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he called it the "pentagon paper") and disagreed with its idea that the united states should try to be the world's only great power over the long term. "for better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach," haass wrote. "it simply is not doable." elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of the wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the united states expanding the "democratic zone of peace": "primacy is not to be confused with hegemony. the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic." haass argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world, not more, and suggested "a revival of what might be called traditional great-power politics."  wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than haass: he is deputy secretary of defense, and haass is director of policy planning for the state department- in effect, colin powell's big-think guy. recently, i went to see him in his office at the state department. on the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff, beginning with george kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that haass now occupies.  it's another indication of the way things are moving in washington that haass seems to have become more hawkish. i mentioned the title of his book. "using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make," he said. "it was written when bill clinton was saying, 'it's the economy, stupid'-not 'it's the world, stupid.' two things are very different now. one, the president has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters. second, at the top of the national-security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."  i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as kennan's containment. "i think there is," he said. "what you're seeing from this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas-i'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the limits of sovereignty. sovereignty entails obligations. one is not to massacre your own people. another is not to support terrorism in any way. if a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone inside your own territory. other governments, including the united states, gain the right to intervene. in the case of terrorism, this can even lead to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. you essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when, and not if, you're going to be attacked."  clearly, haass was thinking of iraq. "i don't think the american public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein," he said. "also, i'd fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the case. public opinion can be changed. we'd be able to make the case that this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense."  on the larger issue of the american role in the world, haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks. he had made a speech not long before called "imperial america," but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist. "i just think that we have to be a little bit careful," he said. "great as our advantages are, there are still limits. we have to have allies. we can't impose our ideas on everyone. we don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to join us. american leadership, yes; but not american unilateralism. it has to be multilateral. we can't win the war against terror alone. we can't send forces everywhere. it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."  he stopped for a moment. "is there a successor idea to containment? i think there is," he said. "it is the idea of integration. the goal of u.s. foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade, democracy, markets. integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more."  the first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein. what the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's been done so far in afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.  several weeks ago, ahmad chalabi, the head of the iraqi national congress, the iraqi opposition party, came through washington with an entourage of his aides. chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask, evidently successfully, for more american funding. his main public event was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute. chalabi's leading supporter in town, richard perle, the prominent hawk and former defense department official, acted as moderator. smiling and supremely confident, perle opened the discussion by saying, "evidence is mounting that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with saddam hussein." the war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete "until saddam is successfully dealt with. and that means replacing his regime. . . . that action will be taken, i have no doubt."  chalabi, who lives in london, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a twinkle in his eye. he was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. although he and his supporters argue that the iraqi national congress, with sufficient american support, can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the taliban in afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in washington. it isn't just that chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel military leader ("he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the savoy, but that's about it," one skeptical former pentagon official told me), or that he isn't in iraq. it's also that saddam's military is perhaps ten times the size that the taliban's was, and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. the united states left iraq in 1991 believing that saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion; chalabi's supporters believe that saddam is much weaker now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off. but non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground troops.  kenneth pollack, a former c.i.a. analyst who was the national security council's staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam. this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two co-authors published an article, also in foreign affairs, arguing that the iraqi national congress was incapable of defeating saddam. pollack still doesn't think chalabi can do the job. he believes that it would require a substantial american ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one we used in kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in afghanistan.  pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day. when i went to see him at his office in washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the middle east were hanging. "the only way to do it is a full-scale invasion," he said, using a pen as a pointer. "we're talking about two grand corps, two to three hundred thousand people altogether. the population is here, in the tigris-euphrates valley." he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra. "ideally, you'd have the saudis on board." he pointed to the prince sultan airbase, near riyadh. "you could make kuwait the base, but it's much easier in saudi. you need to take western iraq and southern iraq"-pointing again-"because otherwise they'll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil fields. you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil fields, so troops have to occupy them. and you need troops to defend the kurds in northern iraq." point, point. "you go in as hard as you can, as fast as you can." he slapped his hand on the top of his desk. "you get the enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once." his hand hit the desk again, hard. "then you crush him." smack.  that would be a reverberating blow. the united states has already removed the government of one country, afghanistan, the new government is obviously shaky, and american military operations there are not completed. pakistan, which before september 11th clearly met the new test of national unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of daniel pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence service, may not be entirely under the control of the president. in iraq, if america invades and brings down saddam, a new government must be established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no obvious, plausible new leader. the prospective iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, russia, is a nuclear superpower. an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations: iran, turkey, saudi arabia, and even egypt. events have forced the administration to become directly involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted to do. so it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way that europe was immediately after the second world war.  in september, bush rejected paul wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate moves against iraq. that the president seems to have changed his mind is an indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the administration's conservatives. "these guys are relentless," one former official, who is close to the high command at the state department, told me. "resistance is futile." the conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is intellectualism. colin powell tends to think case by case, and since september 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading iraq. if the united states applies the doctrines of cheney's old pentagon team, "shaping" and expanding "the zone of democracy," the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.  the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with the administration seem to be bernard lewis, of princeton, and fouad ajami, of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies, both of whom see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation. lewis was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior foreign-policy staff. "one point he made is, look, in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force," the senior official i had lunch with told me-in other words, the united states needn't proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the "arab street," as long as it is prepared to be strong. the senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the middle east charles hill, of yale, who in a recent essay declared, "every regime of the arab-islamic world has proved a failure," and reuel marc gerecht, of the american enterprise institute, who published an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in iran and syria. (those goals, gerecht told me when we spoke, could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)  several people i spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on, if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to finish the job. one purpose of vice-president cheney's recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation. in any event, the administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world's approval. when i spoke to condoleezza rice, she said that the united states should assemble "coalitions of the willing" to support its actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations. an invasion of iraq would test that policy in more ways than one: the administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the iraq operation.  when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal 2003, which begins in october, 2002. much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism. that's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of iraq.  this spring, the administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. a drama involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer, and will end with the united states declaring that the terms that saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions, are unacceptable. then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. the administration obviously feels confident that the united states can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the republican guard, the military key to the country, to turn against saddam and topple him on its own. but the chain of events leading inexorably to a full-scale american invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will begin soon.  lewis (scooter) libby, who was the principal drafter of cheney's future-of-the-world documents during the first bush administration, now works in an office in the old executive office building, overlooking the west wing, where he has a second, smaller office. a packet of public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his 1996 novel, "the apprentice," quotes the times' calling him "dick cheney's dick cheney," which seems like an apt description: he appears absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly rumble. like condoleezza rice and bush himself, he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only truly prudent course.  when i went to see libby, not long ago, i asked him whether, before september 11th, american policy toward terrorism should have been different. he went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder, filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle east. he looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.  "let us stack it up," he said at last. "somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery of the al qaeda-related plot in the philippines; 1993, the world trade center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate president bush, former president bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a serious response to that; 1995, the riyadh bombing; 1996, the khobar bombing; 1998, the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of the cole. throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the iraqis, and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas. no one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that long list and you ask, 'did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our interests? did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against u.s. interests?,' many observers conclude no, and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise up and say credibly, 'the americans don't have the stomach to defend themselves. they won't take casualties to defend their interests. they are morally weak.' "  libby insisted that the american response to september 11th has not been standard or foreordained. "look at what the president has done in afghanistan," he said, "and look at his speech to the joint session of congress"-meaning the state of the union message, in january. "he made it clear that it's an important area. he made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world. he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. and he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part. take the afghan case, for example. there are many other courses that the president could have taken. he could have waited for juridical proof before we responded. he could have engaged in long negotiations with the taliban. he could have failed to seek a new relationship with pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so afraid of weakening pakistan that we didn't seek its help. this list could go on to twice or three times the length i've mentioned so far. but, instead, the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests. the problem is complex, and we don't know yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the states of central asia, pakistan, russia, and, as it may develop, with the states of southwest asia more generally."  we moved on to iraq, and the question of what makes saddam hussein unacceptable, in the administration's eyes. "the issue is not inspections," libby said. "the issue is the iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait, their promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made in '91, and a number of u.n. resolutions, including all the other problems i listed. whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-iraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms. it failed to take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years."  "what's your level of confidence," i asked him, "that the current regime will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"  he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately. "there is no basis in iraq's past behavior to have confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior."  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa "... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience." -- edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'

easy_ham, the only circumstances in which a business will not be ready--indeed,  eager--to do an additional volume of business is if it is physically unable  to do so because it lacks the necessary physical means of doing so, or  because the costs it incurs in doing so exceed the additional sales revenue  it will receive.  that is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  there are a bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of california messed up and the energy producers exploited.  i'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like the blackouts is to reregulate.  ultimately we have to blame the people who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and exploitation.  given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state of california sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?   if there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't necessarily the answer.  you can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  yes, the people  involved were heartless and corrupt.  but mainly they just did their  jobs.  the guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.  - lucas

deregulation  by dan gillmor mercury news technology columnist  the facts were trade and government secrets at the time. but the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in california.  now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. market games helped engineer the price spikes.  the latest manipulation was highlighted in monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. his ruling came a few days after california's public utilities commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.  and don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in may, that ``enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''  how much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. unfortunately, california's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.  more unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. but it's foolish to think that the bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.  if the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. that's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.  state policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes v. john white, executive director of the sacramento-based center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies (www.ceert.org).  it's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. when there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. instead of abandoning deregulation, california should find a way to inject real competition into the market.  we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. smart regulation is essential.  but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. there are two ways: conservation and replacement. we need more of both.  the best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. by 2017, california's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.  but this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.  the state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. this technology is coming along fast. state policies are not keeping pace.  investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. california should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. california hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.  maybe this is all pointless. the bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. never mind what might happen if the coming war in iraq goes badly.  it's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. but the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. we can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. maybe next year.  --  ----------------- r. a. hettinga  the

easy_ham,ok, let's bring some data into the discussion: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm (a graph, derived from vostok ice core samples, of co2 and temperature fluctuations over the past 400k years).   recent high-resolution studies of historical co2 concentrations and  temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest  correlation between the two. in a number of cases, co2 level increases  are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the  increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature  preceded increases in co2 concentrations. the more studies that are done  of the geological record, the more it seems that co2 concentrations are  correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly  causative.  based on the vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and co2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal.   with respect to absolute co2 concentrations, it is also important to  point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly  regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm co2.   as it  happens, current co2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous  cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.  not correct. mauna loa data  and  show that the current co2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded value from the past 400k years. furthermore, co2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the vostok data (though perhaps the vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution).   in other words, we may be adding to the co2 levels,  no, we are *definitely* adding to co2 levels. look at the following chart: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm (shows co2 concentrations since 1870, the "historical record").  not only is the co2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing. there is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. you're really out on the fringe if you're debating this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.   but it looks a lot like we  would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical  record.  at the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current co2  concentrations.  wrong again. current co2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows co2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to "normal" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores).  still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm co2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away.   also, co2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately  affects temperature.  again, the interaction is not entirely  predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative  feedback systems mentioned above.  yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store co2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be enormous.   last, as greenhouse gases go, co2 isn't particularly potent, although it  makes up for it in volume in some cases.  gases such as water and  methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule  basis.  water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something  that co2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the  biosphere.  correct.  data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses: http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm  note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. i'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well.  data on water vapor here: http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html   co2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent  studies and data i've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a  passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  i tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. i favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources of c-h bonds. aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a "sustainable" level are unrealistic -- americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of

easy_ham, [can't think of how i'd be running afoul of the spam filters with this post, so here's the second try...]  kissinger's book _does america need a foreign policy?_ provides a few handy abstractions:   the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between  values ["idealism"] and interests ["realism"] and, occasionally,  between peace and justice.  also, he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers:  hamiltonian - we should only get   involved in foreign adventures   to preserve balances of power.  wilsonian - we should only get   involved in foreign adventures   to further democracy, etc.  jacksonian - we should never get   involved in foreign adventures.   unless we're attacked.  then we   go rambo.  he has tactfully left out the hard realists*; as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists, and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect, and jacksonians  act only when values and interests overlap.  kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian; much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions.  maybe i've been too affected by kant, but i can't see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it: how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics?  - -dave  *  the road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims  of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.  no empire has avoided the  road to caesarism unless, like the british empire, it devolved its  power before this process could develop.  in long-lasting empires,  every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled  very differently from international ones] because the outside world  no longer provides a counterweight.  and as challenges grow more  diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base,  internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.  a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the  values that made the united states great.  kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics: garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down.  in other traditions, a king is a legitimate tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate king.  in the us, i'd hope that we, like samuel, wouldn't naturally make such fine distinctions.

easy_ham, i wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota/sioux country as well.  and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  i do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand from my father.  the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not something that was impressed upon them.  the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals, typically an "indian corporation" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe).  in most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per person, depending on the tribe.  the dividend money comes from a number of places, with the primary sources being the federal gov't and various businesses/assets owned by the indian corporation.  you have to understand a couple things:  first, a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises.  everyone gets a check for their share no matter what.  one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy take their dividend and not work.  the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole "income" for government accounting purposes.  unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends.  many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn, many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk, not indians.  second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  by benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government.  it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other indians, a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non-indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions.  an example of this is the haida corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use.  they don't eat their seed corn, and have actually managed to grow their stash.  in contrast, a couple islands over, there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50 million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  this particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many borrow money against future income.  incidentally, in this particular case, the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets.  somewhat annoying, the federal government semi-regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given where feasible, typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies.  and the cycle continues.  so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  in a nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.  few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  incest, rape, and gross promiscuity is rampant.  inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  on one reservation my parents lived, the hiv infection rate was 70%.  many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police etc).  in short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere.  because of their legal status, there really aren't that many consequences for their behavior.  there are many things that i could tell you that i've seen that you probably would not believe unless you'd seen it yourself.  there are always good people in these tribes, but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times, and this is a mobocracy typically.  (btw, if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up indian reservations.  it will give you an interesting perspective on things.)  there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians.  the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if they maintain their tribal identity.  in both of these cases, the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above.  the indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita.  and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  the poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  this was my original point.   on a tangent:  one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal corporate socialism.  many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run.  it is like a family corporation writ large.  it seems that in a future where "familial" ties will be increasingly voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general western society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting individuals.  damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.  -james rogers  jamesr@best.com     on 9/22/02 3:53 pm, "john hall"  wrote:    as i understand it, there is a huge difference between native americans  who speak english at home and those who do not.  i don't have figures  that separate those at hand, though.    1989 american indians (us pop as a whole) -- families below poverty  27.2% (10%), persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), speak a language other  than english 23 (13.8) married couple families 65.8 (79.5) median family  income $21,619 ($35,225) per capita $8,284 ($14,420).

easy_ham,i attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that jim didn't mention. in terms of cms, the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems: - midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a php-based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full cms - redhat ccm cms, java-based: http://www.example.com/software/ccm/cms/ - opencms, java-based: http://www.opencms.org  there was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength, but both plone and xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation.  i was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on xml. some took for granted that xslt was relevant to content management, others took it just as for granted that xslt was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore xml almost completely.   i attended realizing that "content management" is generally used to apply to *web* content management, but i was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration of the potential print/pdf dimension to content other than the occasional "...and you can use fop to make pdf" as if that was functional): this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management, and probably makes xml easier to ignore (if html is the be-all and end-all of the output...).  the honesty was refreshing, phil suh complained about the state of current tools (both open source and commercial), and i wish i'd written down what he said, something like "it sucks so extremely, it sucks so widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is no hope." for a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial "big boys" were really much more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, "ok, take some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale pretty well." another quote (citing brendan quinn): "content management problems are either trivial or impossible."  mac os x is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3 each of mac, linux, windows.  i am sure it wasn't news to jim, but i can't wait to try subversion, a cvs replacement that supports some of the newer features of webdav: http://subversion.tigris.org/  i'm also eager to try xopus, i hope the developers make it back home safely, they said they'd only been in america four days but were already homeless...  max

easy_ham,dear flatware,  i'm about to undertake a massive project to index/catalog well over one  thousand cds that have been ripped to mp3 and set up a server to stream  them to different rooms in the house. (yes, i own them all, no i'm not  broadcasting them to the 'net.) can anyone give me some recommendations  as to what (free? opensource?) software is best suited for this task? i  know there are a few forks out there who have tackled this problem before...  i'd like to be able to dynamically generate play lists from queries like  "jazz released between 1950 and 1960" or "artist such and such between  these dates" or "just these artists" or "just this genre" - you get the  idea. in addition to having multiple streams that i can tune in to (a la  dmx), i'd like to be able to browse the database through a web interface  from other computers in the house and pull specific music down to  wherever i am.   thanks, elias

easy_ham,this article from nytimes.com  has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.   another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is -- and ought to --be more limited than real property. private money paid for these bits, but expropriation may be fairer for ip than real-p.  rohit  khare@alumni.caltech.edu   vast detail on towers' collapse may be sealed  september 30, 2002 by james glanz and eric lipton         what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan.   amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation's most respected engineering minds. it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit, helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses.   an immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings.   but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information, which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved, may remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed.   bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out. such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation. and as it now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being - has approved standard legal arrangements that, should the lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld.   "we're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but we can't until we're told what to do," said matthys levy, an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates, who is a consultant in the case and the author of "why buildings fall down: how structures fail" (norton, 2nd edition, 2002).   "let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process" of the collapse, mr. levy said.   monica gabrielle, who lost her husband, richard, when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign, said the information should be disclosed. "if they have answers and are not going to share them, i would be devastated," mrs. gabrielle said. "they have a moral obligation."   the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a. silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the trade center property, and a consortium of insurance companies. mr. silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half that amount, as the insurance companies say.   as both sides have prepared their arguments, they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers.   dean davison, a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said of the findings, "there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today." he conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material.   as for his own company, whose consultants alone have produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs, mr. davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to "public authorities and investigative teams."   still, some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources, like the port authority of new york and new jersey, which built and owned the trade center and supports mr. silverstein in the suit. mr. davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company's ability to release information.   in a statement, the port authority said access to documents would be "decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with applicable law and policy," adding that it would cooperate with "federal investigations."   the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell, given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings' collapse. that investigation, led by the federal emergency management agency, was plagued by few resources, a lack of access to crucial information like building plans, and infighting among experts and officials. a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology, or nist, an agency that has studied many building disasters.   officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit.   gerald mckelvey, a spokesman for mr. silverstein, said of the real estate executive's own heavily financed investigative work, "we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation." a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr. silverstein on the material, but said no transfer had taken place.   with no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well.   "the work should be available to other investigators," said ramon gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek, who was a member of the earlier inquiry. "it could be used to build better buildings in the future."   legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes, from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information. in some cases, litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves. or they may ask to have them sealed forever.  "it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another, some legitimate, some not," said lee levine, a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan & koch in washington.   mr. levine said that because of the presumed value of the information, the court might look favorably on requests to make it public. but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people, especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence - not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests - could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center.   "it's important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny," said dr. john osteraas, director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park, calif., and a consultant on the case, "because then the general engineering community can sort it out."   the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure. mr. levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates, hired by silverstein properties, have called upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with the pentagon for classified research, to create a model of the sept. 11 attack from beginning to end.   the result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse. those images - which mr. levy is not allowed to release - have helped pinpoint the structural failures.   the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling. nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks immediately after the attacks. but no such constraints hampered engineers at lza/thornton-tomasetti, brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept. 11. daniel a. cuoco, the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case, said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell.   though the fema team could not determine "where things actually fell," mr. cuoco said, "we've indicated the specific locations."   mr. cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings. nor would mr. osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. mr. osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators.   and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence. for months, experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures.   jack cermak, president of cermak peterka peterson in fort collins, colo., was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. for the legal case, dr. cermak said, "we've done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design."   "the data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact," dr. cermak said. "some of the information may be valuable for the litigation," he said, adding, "i think i've told you all i can."  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30towe.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1    how to advertise --------------------------------- for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media  kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  for general information about nytimes.com, write to  help@nytimes.com.    copyright 2002 the new york times company

easy_ham, from: owen byrne   a flippant remark that i will probably regret  -  sure there's assholes everywhere. i just remember a lunch in spain with  a semi-famous american - i think we had about 10 nationalities at the  table, and he managed to insult each of them within  15 minutes. a historical perspective makes me think that empires -  roman, british, russian, american, whatever - produce   a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more  likely to have them in positions of authority).  yep, those that win battles collect tthe spoils.  lead and breed.  want it to be different?  lead, don't whine.

(which is the gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  the screaming isn't the most effective method around.  i don't believe i argued that it was.  but screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned.   for the record, i don't support the screamers in organized conferences (such as the colin powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  i don't think that this is what the 1st amendment was implying.  these folks -do- have a right to be heard, and i think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place.  my point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases such as mr. nell.   he wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   he has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the representatives that are elected.   a sign is not a shout-out.  i think i may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix.  i was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   in this case, the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with.   they're resorting to creative, offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   the 'my generation never did this ' is all bs.   there's more to this story, we just dont' know it all.  i hope this clarifies my position.   for the quick rehash:  screaming != free speech on all cases. dissent = free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by the supremes.  k?  --  best regards,  bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net

easy_ham,gregory alan bolcer: i'm not sure since i haven't attended civics class in quite some time, but the first amendment doesn't cover protected speech,  hate speech, or actions. ..  the first two are wrong. the first amendment does protect speech the supreme court decides it protects (duh!), and that happens to include most of what people consider hate speech. unlike many other nations, the us has no laws against hate speech, per se. and the first amendment is the reason for that.     _________________________________________________________________ join the world s largest e-mail service with msn hotmail.  http://www.hotmail.com

http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm  m09. dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil. dinosaurs. reptoid ets are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs. this is a description of a dinosaur. it now appears in remote viewing that the reptoid ets, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on earth. the erideans who are reptoid derivatives have a home planet (in the eridanus system) like all other ets. the reptoids have no reported home planet. they also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. this is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them. thus it could be that the reptoids, erideans, nordics, anunnaki, but not the greys, all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth even if they choose to live elsewhere. the greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth. the definitive work on dragons is "the flight of dragons" by peter dickinson. if dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long bow. targets do not come much bigger.  truth is stranger than fiction. thus the writer's current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. they survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty. they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control.  thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs. they must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also to appear to some people. they have appeared to the writer in remote viewing. they are living on as vampire entities. such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. if they can be encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear. encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation. purging people's dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. they are a source of satanic guardian angels and demons. they control us by owning our psi. thus if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers. encourage people to regain ownership of their psi.  the origins of love, hate and pure malice. the following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious.  dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings). they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. in order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. to do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. this is an act of hatred and outward looking. while a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young, most did not. the dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. they have become the source of all satans, devils and demons.  birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm. a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. this is primarily an act of love but inward looking. bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air. a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far. antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm, even if they are standing on ice.  mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking. this is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest.  dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young, while birds and mammals developed love. birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.  if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control, regardless of the front they put out to the public. religion tends to concentrate on "how to brainwash your neighbour". conscious thought has built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using "how to care for and protect one's young" as a foundation.  thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "a load of dinosaur's eggs". purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots.  it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings, aided and abetted by various occultists and other. as they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.  items for inspection. for mind control to take place, then someone must take control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. check for the following.  nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc. eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure

characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult. every extinct race, etc. blood ancestors are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via genetic linkages. some of these can

easy_ham,uh, wwii enigma was cracked at bletchly park, based on the work of some  poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.    entirely mechanical!   definitely not optical at all.    enigma was  originally broken based on bad use practice.  if it had been employed more  sensibly it would have been a lot harder.  see "the code book" by singh, doubleday, 1999.     or, for that matter,  "cryptonomicon" by stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the enigma  cracking story, and pretty accurate.  i eventually get born as a side-effect of the battle of britain, you  see....  computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but enigma  was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially enigma  machines and brute-forcing.  eirikur

easy_ham, over on arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) i saw mention of a wired article that goes into the many wonderfull ways apple is showing its love and respect for its users.  http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html  there is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html  "true to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in their applications. apple's private menu extras apis were reverse engineered and leveraged to great effect. the architecture was so popular that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third party or otherwise) was in development.  all of that changed with the release of jaguar--but not because the private apis had changed. if they had, third party developers would have updated their applications to work with the new apis, as they have resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private apis in the first place.  but what actually happened in jaguar was that apple added code to forcibly exclude all non-apple menu extras. other parts of the api did not change. but when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of "known" menu extras from apple. if the menu extra is not on that list, it is not allowed to load.  it's easy to laugh at steve ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants "developers, developers, developers!", but microsoft clearly understands something that apple is still struggling with. it is in a platform vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. in apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to make every single system service and ui element "pluggable" via public apis. that's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the number one priority for an os in its infancy. and in the meantime, if third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the desired functionality to be added in "unsupported" ways, then they must be prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.  but for apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish.

easy_ham,this article from nytimes.com  has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.   excellent evidence of the herd. just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting.   oh, wait, that happened. an unemployed orange county student took down emulex...  enjoy!   rohit  khare@alumni.caltech.edu   stop those presses! blonds, it seems, will survive after all  october 2, 2002 by lawrence k. altman         apparently it fell into the category "too good to check."   last friday, several british newspapers reported that the world health organization had found in a study that blonds would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. the reports were repeated on friday by anchors for the abc news program "good morning america," and on saturday by cnn.   there was only one problem, the health organization said in a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the subject.   "w.h.o. has no knowledge of how these news reports originated," said the organization, an agency of the united nations based in geneva, "but would like to stress that we have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."   all the news reports, in britain and the united states, cited a study from the world health organization - "a blonde-shell study," as the daily star of london put it. but none reported any scientific details from the study or the names of the scientists who conducted it.   on "good morning america," charles gibson began a conversation with his co-anchor, diane sawyer, by saying: "there's a study from the world health organization, this is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. women and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as brunets."   ms. sawyer said she was "somewhat of a natural blonde."   jeffrey schneider, a spokesman for abc news, said the anchors got the information from an abc producer in london who said he had read it in a british newspaper.   in london, the sun and the express both reported that unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected the last true blond to hail from finland.   the british accounts were replete with the views of bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an endangered species.   journalists in london said last night that the source of the reports was probably one of several european news agencies that are used by the british press, but it remained unclear which one.   tim hall, a night news editor at the daily mail, said the report was probably distributed by the press association, britain's domestic news agency. "several papers picked it up," he said.   but charlotte gapper, night editor at the press association, said that although it had considered running the report on sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking to the world health organization.   "we didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the world health organization first," she said. "they told us that report was two years old, and had been covered at the time. they said it had been picked up again that day by a german news agency."   she added that she did not know which agency the organization was referring to.   dr. ray white, a geneticist at the university of california at san francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for blond hair "sounds patently incorrect."  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02blon.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593    how to advertise --------------------------------- for information on advertising in e-mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media  kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo  for general information about nytimes.com, write to  help@nytimes.com.    copyright 2002 the new york times company

easy_ham, ... nor what color your passport?  more american exceptionalism:    "the united states is the only country in the world to tax its citizens  on a worldwide basis, irrespective of whether they spend time in the  country or whether they have assets there," said philip marcovici,  a zurich-based lawyer with international law firm baker and mackenzie.  and perhaps even irrespective of their current citizenship:   under current expatriation law, there are wealth thresholds based on  net worth which lead to a presumption that a person giving up u.s.  citizenship is doing so for tax reasons.   individuals who have given up their citizenship and who have earned  $100,000 in any one of the 10 years before expatriation, or who have a  net worth exceeding $500,000, would automatically be deemed a so-called  "taxpatriate." those persons would be subject to ordinary income tax  on u.s. source income for 10 years. they would also be subject to  u.s. estate and gift tax during the 10-year period.  i suppose it could be much worse; there could be some twee affinity program for us citizenship, and a bank of phone people who only get paid well if they manage to keep one from cancelling membership...  -dave  :::::::   last month, congress proposed a new exit tax on all citizens who give up  their u.s. status. if the proposal becomes law, individuals will be taxed  as if they had either sold everything or died. this would give rise to  immediate exposure to capital gains tax.  to be fair, would this mean that they'd also immediately pay out the difference for anyone whose tax basis was greater than current estate value?  :::::::    ... australian cities overall scored particularly highly in the  [economist intelligence unit] survey [of desirability for expats],  with all five the country's urban centres surveyed ranked near the  top of the table.    europe was also well represented among the top 10 places.     the top us city, honolulu, ranked 21st, with boston, at 28th, the  highest ranked city on the us mainland. canada, in contrast, sneaked  three cities into the top ten.    the uk cities of london, 44th, and manchester, 50th, gained only a  mid-table rating, with port moresby in papua new guinea bottom of  the list.

the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). similarly, in programming language design, efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. there are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my principles of programming languages). in the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. in other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. fortran's implicit declarations). there are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking).   efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges. compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as programmer time. similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now turn.    economy seeks to maximize benefit versus cost  whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. in structural engineering, economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (this is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) in programming language design, the ``public'' that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work.   economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. for example, the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development.   other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations (such as the us department of defense), whether it has been standardized, whether it comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by novices or dilettantes), and so forth. as can be seen from the historical remarks in my principles, social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language.   often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. also, many social issues, from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. all kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered in seeking an economical design.    elegance symbolizes good design  ``elegance? who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering.   for the designer  it is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my principles for examples). structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but billington observes that the best designers don't make extensive use of computer models and calculation.   one reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. the engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well. also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this is another potential source of error. because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy).   similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical.   many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old tacoma narrows bridge; it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design. billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. however, the very problem that destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles.   according to billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do not abandon it altogether). rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. this is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible solutions to a particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. therefore, expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. the design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable.   the general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. he adds (p. 21), ``when the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' in other words, the choice of form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and economical design). if we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design.   the same applies to programming language design. by restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having to check all the possible interactions.   for the user  in this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. the manifest balance of forces in a well-designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it. so also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the consequences of our actions.   we accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. when the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the outside. so also in programming languages. if the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their (unwarranted) confidence.   in summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. as a consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or programming languages) they design. we may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. we may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my principles of programming languages:                                  the elegance principle                confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good.     the programming language as work environment  there are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. the programming language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. it should feel comfortable and safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it. would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop?   a programming language should be a joy to use. this will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's fatigue and frustration. the programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator, encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. as some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. the programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs.   through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. for example, in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. thus a programming language can promote a set of values. by embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention. out of sight, out of mind.    acquiring a sense of elegance  aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design. billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design, which, especially in europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers. because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. the public also critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers.   so also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively - and criticize, revise and discard your designs. you should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs and try to improve them. in this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing'' comes along.    references     1.billington, david p., the tower and the bridge: the new art of structural engineering, princeton:      princeton university press, 1983. chapters 1 and 6 are the most relevant.      2.maclennan, bruce j., principles of programming languages: design, evaluation, and implementation,      second edition, new york: holt, rinehart & winston (now oxford university press), 1987.

easy_ham,i call pacbell/sbc every two or three months about a recurring problem  we have at my house:  we get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our  house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years  and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! sometimes the  people i talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me  that the phone number doesn't exist. some people are able to locate the  account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we  could get a bill sent to us for that account. some people can locate the  account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years  and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the  lines of "huh?" or "i'm not sure what's going on... hold please." and  eventually i have similar conversations with their managers and the  account representatives and billing people and their managers and their  managers' managers ad naseum.  the outcome of every phone call is that they'll "look into it" and fix  the problem and i might receive one or two more bills depending on when  it's resolved. so i wait a month or two and send the bills back marked  "not at this address, please fsck off." and then eventually call them  back and go through the whole process again. lately i just explain to  the phone jockeys that i know it's not their fault and i'm not mad at  them and it's just not their day because i'm about to give them hell.  then i give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which  they seem all too happy to do.  at least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a  lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.  perplexed, elias   bitbitch@magnesium.net wrote:   so i get a check from pac bell today (sbc as they're called now). turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.

easy_ham,why am i so passionate about decentralization? because i believe some of  today s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by  centralization.  generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one  answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate  agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. in the specific  context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid  value at a time. that limits us to only representing information a)  according to the beliefs of a single agency, and b) that changes more  slowly than it takes to propagate. nevertheless, centralization is the  basis for today s most popular architectural style for developing  network applications: client-server interaction using request-response  communication protocols.  i believe these are profound limitations, which we are already  encountering in practice. spam, for example, is in the eye of the  beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the  separate interests of senders and receivers. slamming, for another,  unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a  centralized auction server. sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a  third example of decentralized resource allocation. furthermore, as  abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these  limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and  communication bandwidth continue to plummet. instead, the speed of light  and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized  information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.   
easy_ham,spamassassin is hurting democracy! owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm  internet can level the political playing field by mike mccurry and larry purpuro  not many months from now, people across the country will experience one  of the great recurring features of american democracy. at shopping  malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front  stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in  public office. while chances are high that we won't know them  personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and  ask for our votes.  just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it  has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.  in this year's gop gubernatorial primary, california secretary of state  bill jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail  addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent  each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.  that day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more  expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio  spots or tv ads. but he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of  35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.  had jones chosen direct mail, radio or tv, that communication would have  been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. few voters  would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from jones  through any of those channels.  the response to jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. he  was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost  entirely negative. to be fair, some of jones' tactics could have been  refined. he used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice  ``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.  his detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but  because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. in fact, jones' online campaign  may have been his most visible asset. in an era of cynicism toward money  in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication  mediums -- jones tried to level the playing field.  no one likes commercial spam. it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be  highly intrusive and even offensive. but as a sophisticated society,  it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different  unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.  the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress  that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. we  believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or  tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. a  simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of  future mailings. direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be  taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads.  when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the  internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them  to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. with more than 60  percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail  accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.  candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the  jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better  ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient  groups.  but the broader point remains. when a political candidate sends a voter  an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without  opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage  the sender. that choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam  advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail.  political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best  they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- mike mccurry, former press secretary for president clinton, is ceo of an  advocacy management and communications software company. larry purpuro,  the former republican national committee deputy chief of staff, is  founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. this was written  for the los angeles times.   http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

"the problem with the french," bush afterwards confided in blair, "is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."  the source was shirley williams, also known as the baroness williams of crosby, who claimed "my good friend tony blair" had recently regaled her with this anecdote in brighton.  lloyd grove of the washington post was unable to reach baroness williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did receive a call from alastair campbell, blair's director of communications and strategy. "i can tell you that the prime minister never heard george bush say that, and he certainly never told shirley williams that president bush did say it," campbell told the post. "if she put this in a speech, it must have been a joke."  this is far from the first time bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities. without straining our memories too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've chronicled on this site. in the summer of 2001, the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of presidential iqs, with george w. bush being pegged as the chief executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel. in december 2000 it was a fake nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win the 2000 presidential election. and in the spring of 2002, it was the story of bush's waving at stevie wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves.  stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after george w. bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever been. it is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always fall upon appreciative ears.  barbara "ears of corn" mikkelson  last updated:   29 july 2002  http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

easy_ham,no analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. but here's the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... best,  rohit  ===========================================================  datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august 27, 2002 5:46 am pt  datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data. unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software, datapower's device processes the data in  hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance,  according to company officials.  the new device, dubbed datapower xa35 xml accelerator, is the first in a  family of products expected from the cambridge, mass.-based startup. the  datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called xg3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the xml  data.  according to steve kelly, ceo of datapower, the xa35 accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml, the anticipated future  proliferation of web services, and as a means to share data between two  businesses.  "our vision is to build out an xml-aware infrastructure," kelly said.  "the xa35 is the first of a family."  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up  to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers; datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative.  in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml.  "today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only," kelly  said. "a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today."  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.  according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.  "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing -- claims that he believes  will be mostly false. other content-aware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)  accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.  the 1u-high network device has been tested against a large collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device.  the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.  in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application  co-processor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device.  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup  sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in  may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spin-off, launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises.  =========================================================================  datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml  grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class m.i.t. engineers and  designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software  interpreter called dgxt. this software-based approach to xml processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing software-based accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purpose-built hardware. in  2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3 ), the  industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.  today, xg3  technology powers the industry's first wire-speed xml  network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and xml web  services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industry-leading customers and partners.  datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.  =========================================================================  datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding  venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer  in xml-aware networking for web services  cambridge, mass. - july 8, 2002 - datapower technology, inc., the  leading provider of xml-aware network infrastructure, today announced  that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for  this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed  capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius,  and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapower s board of  directors.  datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and  sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml-aware networking.  founded in 1999, datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml  networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions  at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services  and other xml-centric initiatives. datapower s solutions are based on  its patent-pending xml generation three (xg3 ) technology.  "enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and  intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.  datapower s xml-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of  xml that is required to support next generation enterprise  applications," said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower  technology.  "datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web  services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." a single  datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10  servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml  processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in  addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,  protection against xml-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of  e-business protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load balancing  between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.  "in the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require  laser-focused scrutiny. datapower s patent-pending technology addresses  a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said michael  tyrrell of venrock associates. "by turbo-charging their networks with  datapower s unique xml-aware networking technology, companies will be  free to adopt next generation web services without encountering  performance and security pitfalls."  "we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly  growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and  security," said bill burnham of mobius venture capital. "datapower is on  their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml  generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most  compelling technology solution we have seen to date."  "xml is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious  about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999, datapower has been  developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web  services," said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. "datapower s  xml-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely  on xml for mission critical applications."  about venrock associates venrock associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the  rockefeller family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs  that now spans over seven decades. laurance s. rockefeller pioneered  early stage venture financing in the 1930s. with over 300 investments  over a span of more than 70 years, the firm has an established a track  record of identifying and supporting promising early stage, technology-  based enterprises. as one of most experienced venture firms in the  united states, venrock maintains a tradition of collaboration with  talented entrepreneurs to establish successful, enduring companies.  venrock's continuing goal is to create long-term value by assisting  entrepreneurs in building companies from the formative stages. their  consistent focus on information technology and life sciences-related  opportunities provides a reservoir of knowledge and a network of  contacts that have proven to be a catalyst for the growth of developing  organizations. venrock's investments have included checkpoint software,  usinternetworking, caliper technologies, illumina, niku, doubleclick,  media metrix, 3com, intel, and apple computer. with offices in new york  city, cambridge, ma, and menlo park, ca, venrock is well positioned to  respond to opportunities in any locale. for more information on venrock  associates, please visit www.venrock.com  about mobius venture capital mobius venture capital, formerly softbank venture capital, is a $2.5  billion u.s.-based private equity venture capital firm managed by an  unparalleled team of former ceos and entrepreneurs, technology pioneers,  senior executives from major technology corporations, and leaders from  the investment banking community. mobius venture capital specializes  primarily in early-stage investments in the areas of: communications  systems software and services;

"our vision is to build out an xml-aware infrastructure," kelly said.   "the xa35 is the first of a family."    kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the   file size up   to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on   application servers; datapower believes an inline device is the best   alternative.    in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount   importance in the world of xml.    "today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only," kelly   said. "a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.   firewalls are blind to xml today."    future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on   security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.    according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml   processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach   the company   itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with   regards to speed   and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to   creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.    "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,   adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly   said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with   technologies that claim to do xml processing -- claims that   he believes   will be mostly false.  other content-aware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)   accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes   of a packet,   while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at   1,400 bytes   and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.    the 1u-high network device has been tested against a large   collection of   xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the   markup language   as they pass through the device.    the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load   balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and   will identify   and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.    in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an   application   co-processor. this deployment method gives administrators   more granular   control over what data is inspected and the application server itself   controls the device.    datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging   market. startup   sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega   xpe switch in   may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spin-off,   launched with a   focus on content processing and acceleration.  the datapower device is now available, priced starting at   $54,995. the   company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in   field trails at a number of other enterprises.    ==============================================================  ===========    datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs   since it was   founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who   foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols   would have on enterprise networks. long before industry   interest in xml   grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class m.i.t. engineers and   designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique   requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was   a software   interpreter called dgxt. this software-based approach to xml   processing   is still licensed by many companies for use in their own   products today.    leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from   developing software-based accelerators, kuznetsov's team   raised the bar   and designed a system for processing xml in purpose-built   hardware. in   2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3 ), the   industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.    today, xg3  technology powers the industry's first wire-speed xml   network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and xml web   services. while other companies are just now marketing first   versions of   products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,   providing an immediate return on technology investments to   industry-leading customers and partners.    datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that   brings decades of experience in the networking and computing   industries,   drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including   akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.    ==============================================================  ===========    datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding    venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital   back pioneer   in xml-aware networking for web services    cambridge, mass. - july 8, 2002 - datapower technology, inc., the   leading provider of xml-aware network infrastructure, today announced   that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for   this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital   and seed   capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham,   of mobius,   and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapower s board of   directors.    datapower will use this funding to accelerate development,   marketing and   sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml-aware   networking.   founded in 1999, datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml   networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and   transactions   at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web   services   and other xml-centric initiatives. datapower s solutions are based on   its patent-pending xml generation three (xg3 ) technology.    "enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and   intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill   prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.   datapower s xml-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed   processing of   xml that is required to support next generation enterprise   applications," said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower   technology.    "datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s   critical to web   services projects without sacrificing an ounce of   performance." a single   datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10   servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml   processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in   addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,   protection against xml-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of   e-business protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load   balancing   between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.    "in the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require   laser-focused scrutiny. datapower s patent-pending technology   addresses   a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said michael   tyrrell of venrock associates. "by turbo-charging their networks with   datapower s unique xml-aware networking technology, companies will be   free to adopt next generation web services without encountering   performance and security pitfalls."    "we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing   the rapidly   growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and   security," said bill burnham of mobius venture capital.   "datapower is on   their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml   generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most   compelling technology solution we have seen to date."    "xml is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious   about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999,   datapower has been   developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web   services," said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. "datapower s   xml-acceleration devices are a key requirement for   enterprises that rely   on xml for mission critical applications."    about venrock associates  venrock associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the   rockefeller family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs   that now spans over seven decades. laurance s. rockefeller pioneered   early stage venture financing in the 1930s. with over 300 investments   over a span of more than 70 years, the firm has an   established a track   record of identifying and supporting promising early stage,   technology-   based enterprises. as one of most experienced venture firms in the   united states, venrock maintains a tradition of collaboration with   talented entrepreneurs to establish successful, enduring companies.   venrock's continuing goal is to create long-term value by assisting   entrepreneurs in building companies from the formative stages. their   consistent focus on information technology and life sciences-related   opportunities provides a reservoir of knowledge and a network of   contacts that have proven to be a catalyst for the growth of   developing   organizations. venrock's investments have included checkpoint   software,   usinternetworking, caliper technologies, illumina, niku, doubleclick,   media metrix, 3com, intel, and apple computer. with offices   in new york   city, cambridge, ma, and menlo park, ca, venrock is well   positioned to   respond to opportunities in any locale. for more information   on venrock   associates, please visit www.venrock.com    about mobius venture capital  mobius venture capital, formerly softbank venture capital, is a $2.5   billion u.s.-based private equity venture capital firm managed by an   unparalleled team of former ceos and entrepreneurs,   technology pioneers,   senior executives from major technology corporations, and   leaders from   the investment banking community. mobius venture capital specializes   primarily in early-stage investments in the areas of: communications   systems software and services;

"a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today."  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.  according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.  "our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code," said kelly,  adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing -- claims that he believes  will be mostly false. other content-aware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)  accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.  the 1u-high network device has been tested against a large collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device.  the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.  in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application  co-processor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device.  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup  sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in  may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spin-off, launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises.  ======================================================================== =  datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml  grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class m.i.t. engineers and  designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software  interpreter called dgxt. this software-based approach to xml processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing software-based accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purpose-built hardware. in  2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3 ), the  industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.  today, xg3  technology powers the industry's first wire-speed xml  network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and xml web  services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industry-leading customers and partners.  datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.  ======================================================================== =  datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding  venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer  in xml-aware networking for web services  cambridge, mass. - july 8, 2002 - datapower technology, inc., the  leading provider of xml-aware network infrastructure, today announced  that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for  this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed  capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius,  and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapower s board of  directors.  datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and  sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml-aware networking.  founded in 1999, datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml  networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions  at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services  and other xml-centric initiatives. datapower s solutions are based on  its patent-pending xml generation three (xg3 ) technology.  "enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and  intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.  datapower s xml-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of  xml that is required to support next generation enterprise  applications," said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower  technology.  "datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web  services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." a single  datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10  servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml  processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in  addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,  protection against xml-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of  e-business protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load balancing  between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.  "in the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require  laser-focused scrutiny. datapower s patent-pending technology addresses  a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said michael  tyrrell of venrock associates. "by turbo-charging their networks with  datapower s unique xml-aware networking technology, companies will be  free to adopt next generation web services without encountering  performance and security pitfalls."  "we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly  growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and  security," said bill burnham of mobius venture capital. "datapower is on  their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml  generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most  compelling technology solution we have seen to date."  "xml is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious  about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999, datapower has been  developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web  services," said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. "datapower s  xml-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely  on xml for mission critical applications."  about venrock associates venrock associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the  rockefeller family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs  that now spans over seven decades. laurance s. rockefeller pioneered  early stage venture financing in the 1930s. with over 300 investments  over a span of more than 70 years, the firm has an established a track  record of identifying and supporting promising early stage, technology-  based enterprises. as one of most experienced venture firms in the  united states, venrock maintains a tradition of collaboration with  talented entrepreneurs to establish successful, enduring companies.  venrock's continuing goal is to create long-term value by assisting  entrepreneurs in building companies from the formative stages. their  consistent focus on information technology and life sciences-related  opportunities provides a reservoir of knowledge and a network of  contacts that have proven to be a catalyst for the growth of developing  organizations. venrock's investments have included checkpoint software,  usinternetworking, caliper technologies, illumina, niku, doubleclick,  media metrix, 3com, intel, and apple computer. with offices in new york  city, cambridge, ma, and menlo park, ca, venrock is well positioned to  respond to opportunities in any locale. for more information on venrock  associates, please visit www.venrock.com  about mobius venture capital mobius venture capital, formerly softbank venture capital, is a $2.5  billion u.s.-based private equity venture capital firm managed by an  unparalleled team of former ceos and entrepreneurs, technology pioneers,  senior executives from major technology corporations, and leaders from  the investment banking community. mobius venture capital specializes  primarily in early-stage investments in the areas of: communications  systems software and services;

easy_ham,politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool  for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole  'anonymity' thing. also i notice this story shows the truth - the  canadian government is really located in washington, dc, ottawa is just  a branch office. come to think of it, the last story i posted about  canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military  hq  in palm beach, florida.' owen ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . *will canada's isps become spies?* by declan mccullagh  staff writer, cnet news.com august 27, 2002, 12:56 pm pt http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html    *washington--the canadian government is considering a proposal that  would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy  surveillance by police and spy agencies.*  a discussion draft   released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every  canadian with an internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the  right to be anonymous online.  the canadian government, including the department of justice   and industry canada  , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step  in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to  conduct electronic surveillance. a proposed law based on the discussion  draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in  early 2003.  arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form,  canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and  combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. they also claim that by enacting  these proposals, canada will be following its obligations under the  council of europe's cybercrime treaty  , which the country is in the  process of considering.  if the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the  possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order internet  providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months, and  permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden  electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. in  most circumstances, a court order would be required for government  agents to conduct internet monitoring.  canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of  europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have  endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty  , which has  drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups.  of nearly 50 participating nations, only albania has formally adopted  ,  or ratified, the treaty.  michael geist , a professor at the  university of ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the  justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems  weak.  "it seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the  changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to  make changes," geist said. "to me that's not a particularly convincing  argument. if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority,  make that case."  geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new  powers) are needed. i don't know that there have been a significant  number of cases where police have run into problems."  probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is  compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure  their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention  orders. the united states has a similar requirement, called the  communications assistance for law enforcement act  , but it  applies only to pre-internet telecommunications companies.  "it is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and  internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical  capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national  security agencies," according to the proposal. companies would be  responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.  sarah andrews, an analyst at the electronic privacy information center   (epic) who specializes in international law, says  the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "their  proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not  just internet providers," andrews said. "the cybercrime treaty deals  only with computer data." epic opposes    the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and  does not adequately respect privacy rights.  another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs  of police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with  personal information about all canadian internet users. "the  implementation of such a database would presuppose that service  providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"  the draft says.  gus hosein, a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an  activist with privacy international, calls the database "a dumb idea."  "immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous  mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the internet  anonymously," hosein said.  a representative for george radwanski  , canada's privacy commissioner, said  the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on  the paper as it stands."  comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca   no later than nov. 15.     
easy_ham,   i'm not sure what you mean by "let's you and him fight", but it is   important to remember that england was in control of ireland  for 300 years ...  exactly -- "let's you and him fight" is a way of dealing with troublesome populations by moving them next to one another, so they give each other, and not the man, grief*.  so by my understanding (and, you all will understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):  ireland:  irish?  uppity barbarians overly    fond of "risings".  scots?  more uppity    barbarians overly fond of "risings".    why not plonk down a bunch of the latter    next to the former and kill two birds    with one stone?  israel:  ex-ottomans?  uppity barbarians    (didn't they help kick out the ottomans?)    zionists?  uppity sorts who aren't happy    with perfectly good land in uganda.  why    not plonk down a bunch of the latter next    to the former and kill two birds with one    stone?  but not:  india: in which the muslims and hindus were     originally intermixed to some degree,     but partioned due to their own conflict,     not due to english resettlement policy.  canada: in which the french and english were     already established, and it was just the     balance of power on the continent that     determined events in the colonies.  the     acadians got resettled, but they don't     seem to have been that good for picking     fights with their neighbors, so no one     had them plonked down next door.  -dave  * this works best with a populace who, given "one man, one vote", immediately deduce "one less man, one less vote" -- eh, magnan?

i hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesn't actually represent the views of europeans.   for various reasons i'm not exactly a cheerleader for the us government, but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.    my personal point is that few americans (percentage of overall population)  have ever left their country, while even german construction workers  regularly spend their holidays in spain. so i'm not surprised that  paranoia is growing.   i'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  the vast majority of people i know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the country at one time or another.  and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have.  despite the best efforts of france, europe is *still* not the center of the universe.  i'll throw you a bone though: most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  but from the perspective of an american, how could you not look at it this way?  the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years.  i love the smell of euro-chauvinism in the morning.  first, you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous.  anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone, never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly foreign.  apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture.  that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language.  a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco, despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country.  if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays, i'll go to oakland, new orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where i live than some countries i've traveled to.  and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany.  second, the state i live in is the size of germany.  when i travel to a neighboring state (which i do regularly), how is this not equivalent?  in fact, i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers.  if you look at the eu as a single country, only then does your analogy become comparable.  what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?  in truth, i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us.  there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us.  the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages, which is hardly something i would call an advantage.  although there are a couple parts of the us where i can't understand a word they are saying either.    -james rogers  jamesr@best.com     
easy_ham,i got to see powell talk in march 2001 at the beginning of his reign at the fcc.  he said they were going to take a real hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse.  one thing he did get right, is that he wasn't worried that the us was behind europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  this is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit.  his legacy was/is supposed to be rethinking the fcc's role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn't want the government forcing business models onto the private sector.  his full transcript is here [1].  interestingly enough i got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole ctia'2001 las vegas keynote series of speakers.  clay and i hoped a flight out of ontario to las vegas to do demo support for craig barrett [2].  his message was that there's no difference between wired and wireless internet--it's all the same thing. instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable content (& using magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform).  the best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all, but really the fact that the venetian had ran out of rooms. they decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high roller rooms.  they put clay in one and me in another. the venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)  greg   [1] http://www.fcc.gov/speeches/powell/2001/spmkp101.html [2]

f.c.c. world   nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc   chairman michael powell.  it's one of the first articles i've seen   that captures some of powell's real personality, and the way he's   viewed in washington.  unfortunately, lemann ends by endorsing   conventional political wisdom.  after describing how powell isn't   really a fire-breathing ideological conservative, he concludes that,   in essence, powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies,   while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants.  i know that's not   how powell sees the world, and though i disagree with him on many   issues, i think he's right to resist the old dichotomy.   the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who   went through it.  the disaster wasn't the regulators' fault, as some   conservatives argue.  but something clearly went horribly wrong, and   policy-makers should learn from that experience.  contrary to lemann's   speculation, the upstart carriers won't be successful in a gore   administration, because it's too late.  virtually all of them are   dead, and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the   foreseeable future.  some may survive, but as small players rather   than world-dominators.    the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is   old news.  the next important battle in telecom will be between those   who want to stay within the traditional boxes, and those who use   different models entirely.  that's why open broadband networks and   open spectrum are so important.  whatever the regulatory environment,   there is going to be consolidation in telecom.  those left out in that   consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into   the home, or slowly die. the victors in the consolidation game will   cut back on innovation and raise prices, which will create further   pressure for alternatives.    lemann is right that policy-making looks much drier and more ambiguous   on the ground than through the lens of history.  but he's wrong in   thinking that telecom's future will be something like its past.   friday, october 04, 2002

other powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.  new yorker, october 8, 2002    last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first   fairly serious american-history course, indignantly reported that the   whole subject was incomprehensible. i was shocked. what about gettysburg   and the declaration of independence and the selma-to-montgomery march?   just look at my textbook, he said, and when i did i saw his point. his   class had got up to the eighteen-forties. what i expected was a big   beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks, and, in-deed,   there was some of that. but the main difference between my son's text   and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous   decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american   history. there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and   reciprocal trade agreements. i skipped ahead, past the civil war, hoping   for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation   of freight rates. only a few decades into the twentieth century did it   become possible to see the federal government's main function as   responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice,   instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.    even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty   speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington, what you'd find   is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so   much over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real   estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. the arena in which   this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and   commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. it's   an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because   the public and the press encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon   can't get themselves interested.    one corner of washington might be called f.c.c. world, for the federal   communications commission. f.c.c. world has perhaps five thousand   denizens. they work at the commission itself, at the house and senate   commerce committees, and at the washington offices of the companies that   the commission regulates. they read communications daily (subscription   price: $3,695 a year), and every year around christmastime they   grumblingly attend the chairman's dinner, at a washington hotel, where   the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating   comedy routine by the commission's chairman.    of all the federal agencies and commissions, the f.c.c. is the one that   americans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with   a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the   american economy, as well as important aspects of daily life telephone   and television and radio and newspapers and the internet. and right now   f.c.c. world is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather,   because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the   "corporate scandals" concerns the economic collapse of companies   regulated by the f.c.c. qwest, worldcom, adelphia, and global crossing,   among others, are (or were) part of f.c.c. world. aol time warner is   part of f.c.c. world. jack grubman, the former salomon smith barney   analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay, of enron, as the   embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of f.c.c. world. in the   past two years, companies belonging to f.c.c. world have lost trillions   of dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a   dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.    this year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state   of the f.c.c. has been circulating widely within f.c.c. world. it evokes   f.c.c. world's feverish mood ("the f.c.c. is fiddling while rome burns")   and suggests why nobody besides residents of f.c.c. world has thought of   the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. the sentence i   just quoted is followed by this explanation: "the ilecs appear likely to   enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no   residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10%   market share loss in business lines to clecs." it's a lot easier to   think about evil c.e.o.s than to decipher that.      even in good times, f.c.c. world pays obsessive attention to the   commission's chairman. in bad times, the attention becomes especially   intense; and when the chairman is a celebrity f.c.c. world devotes   itself to full-time chairman-watching. the current chairman, michael   powell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards,   because he is the only son of colin powell, the secretary of state.   unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which   generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about   who he really is and what he's really up to. powell is young to be the   head of a federal agency he is thirty-nine and genially charming.   everybody likes him. before becoming chairman, he was for three years   one of the f.c.c.'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the   f.c.c.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a clintonesque love of the   arcane details of communications policy. he's always saying that he's an   "avid moderate." and yet he has a rage-inciting quality. one of his   predecessors as chairman, reed hundt, quoted in forbes, compared powell   to herbert hoover. mark cooper, of the consumer federation of america,   calls him "radical and extreme." just as often as he's accused of being   a right-wing ideologue, powell gets accused of being paralytically   cautious. "it ain't about singing 'kum-ba-yah' around the campfire,"   another former chairman, william kennard, says. "you have to have an   answer." one day last spring, powell, testifying before a senate   subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the   subcommittee's chairman, ernest hollings, of south carolina, berated   him. "you don't care about these regulations," hollings said. "you don't   care about the law or what congress sets down. . . . that's the   fundamental. that's the misgiving i have of your administration over   there. it just is amazing to me. you just pell-mell down the road and   seem to not care at all. i think you'd be a wonderful executive   vice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a   regulatory commission at the government level. are you happy in your job?"    "extremely," powell said, with an amiable smile.      one cannot understand powell's maddening effect, at least on democrats   and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose   of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. the f.c.c. was   created by congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the   new deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy   cases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure   that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. its   other original function was preventing american telephone & telegraph,   the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers   unfairly. over the decades, as f.c.c. world grew up into a comfortable,   well-established place, the f.c.c. segued into the role of industrial   supervision its real purpose. it was supposed to manage the competition   among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by   artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business.   in addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission   more specifically protected the interests of members of congress, many   of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most   terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank   president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster.   according to an oft-told f.c.c. world anecdote, president clinton once   blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers   in the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the   anti-clinton little rock democrat-gazette had owned the leading tv   station in little rock, too, clinton would never have become president.      f.c.c. world may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too,   because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic   niches for themselves. then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful   breakup of a.t. & t. by far the biggest and most important company the   commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of   self-confidence onto the consciousness of f.c.c. world. a generation   ago, for most americans, there was one local phone company, one   long-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones,   which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same   company. it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. by the   mid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local   phone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing   to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores   everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and   millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the   telephone lines. a.t. & t. had argued for years that it was a "natural   monopoly," requiring protection from economic competition and total   control over its lines. so much for that argument. over the same period,   the f.c.c. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones   and the internet. it was the dream of federal-agency success come true:   consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more   prosperous, too.    the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of 1996,   one of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which   most people outside f.c.c. world probably felt it was safe to ignore.   although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of   modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group   bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers   as "baby bells" and to f.c.c. world as "arbocks" (the pronounced version   of rbocs, or regional bell operating companies), would be permitted to   offer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance   companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for   customers. consumers would win, because for the first time they would   get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more   competition than they already had in long distance. but the politics and   economics of the telecom act (which was shepherded through congress by   vice-president gore) were just as important. democrats saw the act as   helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that   brought the internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of   jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose   beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. clinton's   slogans about the "information superhighway" and "building a bridge to   the twenty-first century," which, like all clinton slogans, artfully   sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical   correlates of the telecom act, and gore's cruise to the presidency was   supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.    the f.c.c. had a crucial role in all this. the arbocks are rich,   aggressive, politically powerful, and generally republican (though like   all important interest groups they work with both parties); they   immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new   competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. through   rule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the f.c.c., then headed by   reed hundt, who was gore's classmate at st. albans, was supposed to keep   the arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies   like a.t. & t. and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new   companies, "see-lecks" (the pronounced version of clecs, or competitive   local exchange carriers), could emerge. this entailed the regulatory   equivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have   access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the   seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the see-leck asks the   f.c.c. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.    partly because hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that   he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming   condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the   see-lecks companies with names like winstar, covad, and teligent and   into other telecommunications companies. even not obviously related   technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom   boom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks   and other new players. there would be no conflict between the interests   of the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of hundt's   former lieutenants told me, "reed used to joke that my job was to make   sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."      the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the   boom. wall street had its blood up, and that meant not just more   startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies:   time warner and aol decided to throw in together, and a.t. & t. and   comcast, and so on. (surely, worldcom and the other telecom bad guys   believed that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative   accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)    by the time the outcome of the 2000 presidential election had been   determined, the telecom crash was well under way. nonetheless, the   chairmanship of the f.c.c. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of   influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator.   three republicans emerged as candidates: powell, who was a commissioner;   harold furchtgott-roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and   patrick wood, the head of the texas public utility commission and, as   such, a george w. bush guy. in texas, however, wood had crossed the most   powerful person in the arbock camp, edward whitacre, the c.e.o. of   s.b.c. communications, which is headquartered in san antonio. this meant   that the arbocks didn't want wood as head of the f.c.c., because he   might be too pro-see-leck. (wood is now the head of the federal energy   regulatory commission.) michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he   wasn't as threatening as wood, while also signalling the conservative   movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than   furchtgott-roth.    powell did this deftly. for example, in december of 2000 he appeared   before a conservative group called the progress & freedom foundation and   gave a very michael powell speech whimsical, intellectual, and   free-associative (biblical history, joseph schumpeter, moore's law) that   began by making fun of the idea that the f.c.c. should try to keep new   telecom companies alive. "in the wake of the 1996 act, the f.c.c. is   often cast as the grinch who stole christmas," powell said. "like the   whos, down in who-ville, who feast on who-pudding and rare who-roast   beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the   deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act's   fertile soil. but this feast the f.c.c. grinch did not like in the   least, so it is thought." thus powell was indicating that if he became   chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as   part of the job. he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day   of the bush administration.    twenty months into the administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead   or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just worldcom, are in   serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite   companies are staggering. the crash has had an automatically   concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing   companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in   good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged   companies at bargain prices. during the bush administration, as the   financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications   industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. if the bells   wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and   if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national   duopoly in local service: verizon, in the east, and s.b.c., in the west.   and these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the   poor health of the long-distance companies.    the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national   companies, aol time warner and comcast. unlike the phone companies, they   don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more   fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. as part   of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996   telecom act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were   significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of   radio-station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty-five   per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news   programming is supplied by a single company, westwood one, a subsidiary   of viacom.    in this situation, many democrats and liberals think, the f.c.c. should   be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation, springing to the   rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. it should try   to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. it should   disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the   forces of concentration. it should use the government's money and muscle   to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the   homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (an   analogy that a lot of people in f.c.c. world make is between telecom and   the middle east: the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush   people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the bush   people blame it on the clinton people, because they raised too many   expectations and stirred too many passions.)    but michael powell's f.c.c. has not been hyperactive. powell has been   conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the   f.c.c. and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him   signals. (in mid-september, powell finally initiated a formal review of   the f.c.c.'s limits on media concentration.) this doesn't mean he has   been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further   infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and   the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of   f.c.c. world really make sense, while giving the impression that he's   having the time of his life as chairman. at his first press conference,   when he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital   divide" that is, economic inequality in access to the internet he said,   "you know, i think there is a mercedes divide. i'd like to have one and   i can't afford one." at the national cable & telecommunications   association convention, in chicago, powell, following a troupe of   tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a   somersault.      not long ago, i went to see powell in his office at the f.c.c. until   1998, when the commission moved to a new building in southwest   washington, near the city's open-air fish market, f.c.c. world was at   the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody   else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. today, the f.c.c. building   looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park.   even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and   fluorescent. powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and   walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a   jeep accident in germany, in 1987, when he was an army officer. because   of the accident, he left the army and went to law school, where he   became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly   the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of   the market before the fact "prophylactically," as he likes to say should   wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust   litigation to fix them. he worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and   then became a prot g  of joel klein, the head of the antitrust division   of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government's   legal case against microsoft. (he was recently appointed chancellor of   the new york public-school system.) it testifies to powell's political   skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush   administration who not only served in the clinton administration but   also maintains close ties to bush's nemesis senator john mccain, of   arizona. one of the things about powell that annoy people is his   enduring love of law school "it's sort of like a law-school study   session over there," one democratic former commissioner said. as if to   confirm the charge, powell, when i arrived, introduced me to four law   students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.    i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions   of the f.c.c. for example, could private companies have apportioned the   airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?    "i think we'll never know," powell said. "i don't think it's an   automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. land is probably   the best analogue. we don't seize all the land in the united states and   say, 'the government will issue licenses to use land.' if my neighbor   puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law   about what i can do about that, including whether i can tear it down. if   a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a   similar proposition. there are scholars who argue indeed, the famous   ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that   spectrum policy is lunacy. the market could work this out, in the kinds   of ways that we're accustomed to."    talking to powell was fun. unlike most high government officials, he   doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. he   slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. he speaks in   ironic air quotes. he's like your libertarian friend in college who   enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions   about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he   sees as sentimental or illogical. after a while, i asked him whether he   thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 telecommunications   act had been excessive.    "i would start with a caveat," powell said. "look, i can't fault those   judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought.   they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities.   but, frankly, i've always been a little bit critical. first of all,   anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close   to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the president   on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. i mean, i   don't know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions,   or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that   were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. when one starts   reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions.   but, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an internet   excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it   certainly was.    "but. we were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of   expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the   economy or the market even gets in trouble. it was a dramatically   exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission, by   politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. it was a   gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones   that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. everybody wanted to   see numbers go up on the board."    powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act. "   'i want to see ten competitors. twenty competitors! i want to see   thirty-per-cent market share. fifty-per-cent market share! i want the   bells to bleed! then we'll know we've succeeded.' " now powell returned   to being powell. "i think that expectation was astonishingly   unrealistic, in the short term. they wanted to see it while they're   there. we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. and   the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. there's no   question, we went too soon too fast. too many companies took on too much   debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model."    how could the telecom act have been handled better? "we could have   chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were   slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"   powell said. "money chased what seemed like government-promised   opportunity. the problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're   in it. and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. this   debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. in some   ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."    powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there   had been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "no, we wouldn't have   every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don't anyway. i   don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. i don't buy   that. the bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? the   part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so   would mci worldcom and sprint."    other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable   businesses, either, and they never might. "everybody's always saying,   'the regulators did this and this and this.' but, candidly, the story's   quite the opposite. i think the regulators bent over backward for six   years to give them a chance. conditions don't get that good except once   every thirty years, and it didn't happen. so, whatever the reason, we're   looking at a worldcom that's teetering. we're looking at a long-distance   business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. a.t. & t. is   breaking itself up. sprint has struggled."    could the f.c.c. have done anything to make the long-distance companies   stronger? "at the f.c.c.? i think i'll just be blunt. my political   answer? yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try   to help. but i can't find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere.   i can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s.e.c.   investigation. were i king, it would be wonderful, but i don't have   those kinds of levers. i don't know whether anybody does. at some point,   companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from   dying." powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think   it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. he has   demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist   gestures in august, for example, five months after disbanding the   f.c.c.'s accounting safeguards division, powell announced that he was   appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the   communications industry. but that shows that powell is better at riding   out the storm than, say, harvey pitt, his counterpart at the securities   and exchange commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore   up the telecom industry.    i asked powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one   company provided cable television and only one provided local phone   service. "yes," he said. "it concerns us that there's one of each of   those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one   of each of those things. that still is a nice suite of communications   capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."   anyway, powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to   provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will   provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice.   "so, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. the question   is, does it stay that way?"    the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of   information did not appear to trouble powell, either. he said that   people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration,   which distorts markets. "if this were just economics, it's easy. if you   were to say to me, 'mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we   know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust. i can tell you when a   market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. the problem is   other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. take   the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption   there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic   viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. i   think that's a possibility. i don't think it's nearly the possibility   that's ascribed to it sometimes."    powell explained, "sometimes when we see very pointed political or   parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. i see some of the   same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh   exists. they love diversity, but somehow we should run howard stern off   the planet. if it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias,   and then we have policies like" here his tone went from ironic to   sarcastic "the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis   of what i thought those people cared about. so when somebody is pointed   and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic   fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."      f.c.c. world abounds in theories about michael powell. one is that he   can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries   he regulates so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the   market, in order to buy himself time. another is that he's carrying   water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. another is that he is   planning to run for the senate from virginia (or to be appointed   attorney general in a second bush term), and doesn't want to do anything   at the f.c.c. that would diminish his chances. another is that he's   waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action,   so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the   crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television   networks. (in f.c.c. world, this is known as the powell doctrine of   telecom, after colin powell's idea that the united states should never   commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force,   and an exit strategy.) and another is that he actually believes what he   says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and   irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.    "this is why elections matter," reed hundt, who isn't happy about what   has become of his telecom act, told me. it's true that the f.c.c. much   more than, say, the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore   administration would be acting quite differently from the bush   administration. consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but   there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. the   arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would   have done if gore had won. next election, they'll help the party that   helped them. if the republicans win, policy will tilt further in the   arbocks' favor. if they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivals the   long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their   friends now in power, will stage a comeback. america's present is not   unrecognizably different from america's past.       --  gregory alan bolcer, cto  | work: +1.949.833.2800 gbolcer at endeavors.com  | http://endeavors.com endeavors technology, inc.| cell: +1.714.928.5476           
easy_ham,  begin forwarded message:   from: ian andrew bell   date: wed oct 9, 2002  11:16:09 pm us/pacific  to: mike@michaelmoore.com  cc: foib@ianbell.com  subject: [politicos] re: "bowling for columbine," opens this friday   michael,   why is it that people who consider voting in an election an   inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message?    don't get me wrong -- i think this is the case.  people will go to   see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to   express their malice and discontent towards not only the present   regime in america, but also the corrupt, empty, shallow pantomime   which cast them into power.   in reality, today the voting that takes place via the act of   consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth   and dimpling the appropriate chad, or some other such convoluted act   of free democratic expression.   why?  because in america, they believe in dollars.  dollars don't lie.    in practise, they are the last frontier of truth in america,   universally accepted as expressions of fear, desire, passion, and   need.  compared to the swing of the almighty buck, and jeb bush knows   this, a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning.   given that fact, i modestly propose an entirely new, though wholly   logical, extension to the current democratic system in place in   america:   i propose we augment, and effectively replace, the electoral system   with a political stock market.  we should accept that politicians are   entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america, and   embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects   their intent.  a politician should issue a constant number of shares   dependent upon his tenure in government.  those shares should be   traded on an open exchange, say the g.r.e.e.d. (short, of course, for   the "global realists' electoral exchange -- democratic").  politicians   we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their   ability to maintain office grows.  as the truth about their embezzling   campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is   revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.   this represents an opportunity for the market forces -- those same   forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal   protest -- to voice their opinion on the quality of america's   governance during the intervening four years between elections.    elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are   now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each   and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.   just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc!  "strom   thurman (strom: news - quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his   latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed   services committee meetings until november.."  this would provide   rejuvenating content to the econo-political news sector, which has   found post-economic-bubble coverage to be both tiresome and   deoressing.  the establishment of this new stock exchange would of   course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained)   it systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities   exam, become floor traders.   this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which   candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their   multi-billion-dollar campaigns.  the requirement for the support of   legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor   relations personnel would also create jobs -- perhaps even a new   practice for ernst & young, arthur anderson, et al.  insider trading   scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch   martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her   influence to politics.   dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician's   career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.    pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support   necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set.    union funds, brokerages, and even pump-and-dump houses could benefit   from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the   southeast, and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social   security bets where they really mattered.   investors who lose their   retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they   were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.   although there's no way to protect any of these for worldcom-like   crashes, ambitious, inspired, district attorneys could file criminal   suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform   expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty   -- instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.   on the whole, i believe the system could work.  i could certainly work   as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the   american electoral system's success at effectively expressing the will   of the people, it certainly couldn't do any worse...   in the meantime, mike, i think i'll go see your movie and try to   depose the president.   -ian.     on wednesday, october 9, 2002, at 03:53 pm, michael moore's mailing   list wrote:   october 9, 2002   my film, "bowling for columbine," opens this friday   dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers:   i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday, october 11,   my  new  film, "bowling for columbine," will open in new york and los angeles.   it is, i promise, the last thing the bushies want projected on the   movie  screens across america this week. the film is, first and foremost, a  devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for   profit  and power -- and no one, in all the advance screenings i have   attended, has  left the theatre with anything short of rage. i truly believe this   film has  the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do   something.   this is not good news for junior and company. not when they are   trying to  drag us into another war. not when a crazed sniper is exercising his  constitutional right to own a high-powered rifle. not when john   ashcroft is  still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background   check  files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased   any  weapons prior to 9/11 -- because that, we are told, would "violate"   these  terrorists' sacred second amendment rights!   yes, i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc -- but i will   need all  of you to help me do this. are you game?   last february 5th, i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and   how  the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to   publish  anything critical of bush after 9/11. i appealed to you to save   "stupid  white men" from the shredder and to go out and buy it. i promised you   would  not regret it, and that the book would not only be a great read but an  important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w. bush.   within 24 hours, the book went to #1 on the amazon best seller list.   by the  fifth day, the book was already into its 9th printing. the publisher   was  torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money.   greed won  out, and this sunday the book enters its 31st week on the new york   times  best seller list -- and its 32nd printing. this is all because of   you, my  crazy and loyal friends. you made this happen, against all the odds.   now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work,   "bowling  for columbine." it's a movie that many critics have already called my   best  film to date. they may be right. it is certainly the most provocative   thing  i have ever done. i have spent three years on it and, i have to say,   it  cuts  deeper, harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far.   the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles, and then in   8 more  cities next week. how it does in these first ten cities will determine  whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it. that is the   nutty  way  our films are released. if it doesn't have a big opening weekend, you   can  kiss the film good-bye. therefore, this weekend, this film must be   seen by  millions of americans. can you help me make that happen?   "bowling for columbine" is not a film simply about guns or school  shootings.  that is only the starting point for my 2-hour journey into the dark   soul of  a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of   violence,  both at home and around the world. with this movie i have broadened my  canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st  century, a nation that seems hell-bent on killing first and asking  questions  later. it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and  terrorism against our own poor, and how we have created a culture of   fear  that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore. and it's a  devastating comedy.   this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts. no film has   ever  said the things i am saying in "bowling for columbine." i expect to be  attacked. i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of  retribution. i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many   to  swallow.   this is why i need your help. movies live or die based on what   happens at  the box office the first weekend of its release. i need you, if you   live in  the new york or l.a. area, to go see "bowling for columbine" this   friday  and  saturday -- and take as many family members and friends with you as  possible. i guarantee you will not be disappointed -- and you may   just see  one of the best films of the year.   monday night in times square, "bowling for columbine" had its   premiere. the  crowd was amazing, as it was this past saturday night at the chicago   film  festival. the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud  throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line.   the hate mail, the threats, the promises of retribution have already  started  to roll in to the distributor of this movie, united artists. they are   not  backing down. but how long will this last? i need all of you in the   new  york  tri-state and southern california areas to go see "bowling for   columbine"  this weekend -- the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when   it  comes to your town. a strong opening not only means that the rest of  america  will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it   are  going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved.   if it  does poorly, i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the   movie  i want to make next -- a film about 9/11 and how bush is using that   tragic  day as a cover for his right-wing agenda.   don't let that happen. don't let the nra have one more success by   stopping  the wider distribution of this movie. and, together, let us not remain  silent in our opposition to bush's phony war against iraq.   if you live in new york, you can see it at the lincoln plaza, the   sunshine  and the loews 19th st. in l.a., you can catch it at the sunset 5, the  westwood regent, laemmle sunset, laemmle towncenter (encino), landmark  rialto (pasadena), and regal university (irvine). also, please   forward this  to your other friends and tell them to go see "bowling for columbine"   this  weekend.   and finally, don't miss our new website www.bowlingforcolumbine.com   thank you for your help with this. i feel so honored and privileged   to have  so many people interested in my work. last january i was getting   70,000  hits  a month on my website. last month, i got 17 million hits. this alone   speaks  volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and   tired  of what is going on and are longing for an alternative source of  information.   i hope that you enjoy "bowling for columbine."   thank you again...   yours,   michael moore   ---   if you wish to be be unsubscribed from this mailing list, please   click the  link below and follow the instructions.   http://www.michaelmoore.com/mailing/unsubscribe.php

easy_ham,i have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now.   (it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for ups's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...)  first, i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. this one solves the initial problem:  --- mh.tcl.was thu aug 22 21:15:06 2002 +++ mh.tcl wed aug 28 12:39:11 2002 @@ -487,6 +487,10 @@      set seq {}      set rseq {}      foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] { + if ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] { +     # just ignore anything bogus +     continue; + }   set parts [split [string trim $range] -]   if {[llength $parts] == 1} {       lappend seq $parts   that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either nnn or nnn-mmm so we should probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just "continue" if you like, but i don't think an error is needed).  but that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing "nnn-" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, i thought i should think more about brent's suggestion.   but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so i just stuck a "catch" around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed.  this way, any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like "prev" or "next", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.  but, while i was playing there, i noticed something i never new before. if you type "66+" the "66" changes to "67" (and so on, for each + that is typed).   i suspect that's perhaps an artifact of "+ is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean...", but now i found it, i think its nice.    but if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  that kind of limitation bugs me, so i fixed it.  and then i wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard.   so i fixed that as well.   this makes two different restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '+' (but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway, so i doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name being typed is empty.   i'm less happy about that part, but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to exist and be typed.  then, since i was there anyway, i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me.   in "normal" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message.    but if you've just typed 123, and the ftoc is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead. so i "fixed" this one as well.   "fixed" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here.   i don't know enough tk/tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.  and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code, i also made it clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^c or ^g). previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings.  in any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   i believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the "catch" around the "msgshow" will hide the problem (i don't think we really need to fix brent's way of invoking it).   or include it anyway, just for completeness (i haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so i don't know for sure that all will be ok then).  kre  --- select.tcl.was thu aug 22 21:15:07 2002 +++ select.tcl wed aug 28 13:36:17 2002 @@ -49,9 +49,11 @@      bindtags $w [list $w entry]      bind $w  {selecttypein %w %a}      bind $w  {selecttoggle %w } +    bind $w  {selectprev %w }      bind $w  {selectcomplete %w}      bind $w  {selectcomplete %w}      bind $w  {selectreturn %w} +    bind $w  {selectreturn %w %a}      bind $w  {selectbackspace %w}      bind $w  {selectbackspace %w}      bind $w  {selectbackspace %w} @@ -72,7 +74,7 @@      append select(sel) $a      exmh_status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"      if ![info exists select(folder)] { - msg_change $select(sel) noshow + catch { msg_change $select(sel) noshow }      }  }  proc selectbackspace { w } { @@ -91,6 +93,10 @@  proc selecttoggle {w} {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$select(sel) != ""} { +     selecttypein $w + +     return + }   set select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]   set select(prompt) "[lindex $select(toggle) 0] folder:"      } else { @@ -101,6 +107,18 @@      }      exmh_status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"  } +proc selectprev {w} { +    global select +    if [info exists select(folder)] { + selecttypein $w "-" +    } else { + catch { +     incr select(sel) -1 +     msg_change $select(sel) noshow + } +        exmh_status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)" +    } +}  proc selectcomplete { w } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { @@ -126,9 +144,13 @@   exmh_status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"      }  } -proc selectreturn { w } { +proc selectreturn { w {a {}} } {      global select      if [info exists select(folder)] { + if {$a != {}} { +     selecttypein $w $a +     return + }   if [info exists select(match)] {       set select(sel) $select(match)       unset select(match) @@ -151,6 +173,7 @@   unset select(folder)      }      $select(entry) configure -state disabled +    exmh_status ""      exmh_focus  }  proc selectclear { w } {     _______________________________________________ exmh-workers mailing list exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

easy_ham, from:  anders eriksson   date:  mon, 26 aug 2002 20:00:36 +0200     lately i've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. i   just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the   scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.    i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000   msgs). the delay of the next button has increased considerably:    2.5-release: 350-450 msec  latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec    frankly i think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the   user settings hasn't changed.    anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?  here's a fix that i think will make a real difference.  ftoc_showsequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids  to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those  messages.  then in places like msgchange, we only update the messages which have changed.  also, a separate ftoc_showsequence function which only updates the display of  one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.   in a place like msgchange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.  if nobody else gets to it, i'll do this when i get back.  chris  --  chris garrigues                 http://www.deepeddy.com/~cwg/ vircio                          http://www.vircio.com 716 congress, suite 200 austin, tx  78701  +1 512 374 0500    world war iii:  the wrong-doers vs. the evil-doers.

easy_ham,well, i've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective.  however, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read?  perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view?  just idle speculation - we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.  someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log. we could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 - tcl has had "clock seconds" (like gettimeofday) and "clock clicks" (high resolution timer) for some time.  but in 8.3 we've calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds.  it is still only useful for relative times, but each call to exmh_log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record.  of course, we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  i'll try it out.  chris garrigues said:    from:  brent welch     date:  wed, 28 aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700           robert elz said:      mh_sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the      context file) but i'm not sure how frequently that one is called.        in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify   time,    but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to    check their date stamp, you could just read them again.      do you really think this is true?  i added a modify time check thinking   that    it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times   in    the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.      on the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of   cache    when that happens anyway.      even with a small file, i'd think that the time taken to do a    [file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  my code is in proc   mhreadseqs.      chris      --    chris garrigues                 http://www.deepeddy.com/~cwg/   vircio                          http://www.vircio.com   716 congress, suite 200   austin, tx  78701  +1 512 374 0500        world war iii:  the wrong-doers vs. the evil-doers.        -- brent welch software architect, panasas inc pioneering the world's most scalable and agile storage network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com    _______________________________________________ exmh-workers mailing list exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

easy_ham,2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 - byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in its parsing than the original parser.  you can only have a comment where tcl would expect to find a command.  switch has a "pattern - body" strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  the subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. i can't give you the exact case, but i know exmh had one example that stopped parsing correctly, and was arguably wrong before.  2nd - i've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the pgp support in exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.  reg clemens said:    if you haven't already, you should enable the debug log under    hacking support preferences and look for clues there.        reg clemens said:       hi,              on sun, 01 sep 2002 00:05:03 mdt reg clemens wrote:                 [...]        in messages with gnupg signatures.  but punching the line always        gives                        signature made thu aug 29 00:27:17 2002 mdt using dsa key i      d bdd         f997a                can't check signature: public key not found                so, something else is missing.              yes, the public key of the signature you want to check :-).              are you really sure that you have the public key of the message's       signature? if not, try downloading it or try to check a signature fro      m       which you know you have the public key.                                 ah, sorry for not making that clearer.      but no.      previously (v1.0.6 of gnupg) there would be a slight pause at this poin      t whi         le      it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.      now, whether i have the key or not, i get the failure message.            its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but i fixed that path), so th      ere      must be something else that i am missing...                  --                                               reg.clemens                                              reg@dwf.com                              _______________________________________________      exmh-users mailing list      exmh-users@redhat.com      https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users        --    brent welch    software architect, panasas inc    pioneering the world's most scalable and agile storage network    www.panasas.com    welch@panasas.com             partial solution.   and this may be related to using tcl/tk 8.4b1, as i had a similar   problem about a month ago elsewhere in exmh (which you found).      but first.   i really feel like something has changed out from under me   with my making no changes to exmh.  namely, when i first got   gpg up and working (for reading signatures) all i did was   touch the 'check signature' button' and it went out and queried   the keyserver for me.   now im getting a separate box, after the failure to find the   public key on my keyring, asking me of i want to 'query keyserver'      i know that i never had to touch a 'query keyserver' button in   the past, but there it is now, and i havent touched exmh. spooky.      i have been working back and forth between gpg 1.0.6 and 1.0.7   but its not clear how that could be the problem, as im now getting   the 'query' message when running either...      ---      ok, enough about my confusion.   the current problem seems to be a comment in a switch statement   at line 86 in pgpwww.tcl.  tcl 8.4b1 doesnt like it and i get your   popup box.  remove it and no popupbox, but exmh hangs (sigh).   so, not a complete solution, but at least a start.      thanks for the interest.           reg.clemens        reg@dwf.com  -- brent welch software architect, panasas inc pioneering the world's most scalable and agile storage network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users  
easy_ham,i use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to the relevant folder using rcvstore.  recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk. i'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept mail from the new location.  there seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). it says at the top of the file not to edit these lines. so, i went ahead and edited it :-) that does not make a difference.  it seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. so, i need to configure that probably.  any idea how i would do this?  thanks siva    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

(is that permitted? :)  i started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with winder$.  i just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to winder$) anyway. so, i jumped ship and became my own sysadm.  what i got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  i can do email for the office fairly easily.  i haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  but, i have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.  -=d    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

easy_ham, the way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (preferences  - hacking support - debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands  being issued and the responses.  fwiw, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 i do not have problems sending  encrypted messages to myself. when i select the message, an xterm  window pops up asking for the passphrase. i don't recall exmh ever  asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a  dialog box.

easy_ham,i've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. here's the  behaviour i have. i have exmh and xemacs windows up, and a terminal window. (i  also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) i select text in the exmh  window and while it is highlighted, i can paste into anything else. if i select  it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what i paste is not the  recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. if i select in xemacs and  leave it highlighted, i can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no  longer highlighted, what i paste is an old selection. i can live with this  behaviour except for one additional thing. if nothing is highlighted, then what  i paste into exmh is different from what i paste into other windows. to be more  specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:  application       what gets pasted  xemacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh xterm             same as xemacs abiword           nothing nedit             nothing sedit             whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten  the last needs some amplification. if i highlight something in sedit, then  obviously that's what gets pasted. if the highlighting is off, then what gets  pasted is not what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted  and typed over (i have "type kills sel" on.).  it seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. very often when i try to  paste something in sedit i end up muttering wtf??  -- rick    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

easy_ham,on fri, 13 sep 2002, dale alspach wrote:  my experience has been that if the item is showing in xclipboard  and is highlighted that is what is pasted using the mouse.  classic x copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is currently highlighted.  in fact, it is the act of highlighting a selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  x has no "copy" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.   this does not seem to override what is in an application's own  paste buffer. as far as i can tell maple's cut and paste, for  example, is isolated.  if ab application has a "copy" command that you can choose to use separately from the process of highlighting something, that command is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (and it it likely that an application that wrote an internal "copy" command would also have their own customized "paste" command, to make sure the two work together.)  whether the internal (custom) select and paste functions interoperate with the x server's global select and paste functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.    jacob morzinski                                jmorzins@mit.edu    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

easy_ham,make sure you rebuild as root and you're in the directory that you downloaded the file.  also it might complain of a few dependencies but you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find on your red hat cd, red hat ftp, or rpmfind.net.  after you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in /usr/src/redhat/rpms/i386.  with all dependencies met, install mplayer with 'rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm' and you should be good to go.  one last thing, you will need the win32 codecs, i found them on google, create a directory /usr/lib/win32 and place the codecs in there.  good luck!  lance  on thu, 2002-01-31 at 23:44, rob bains wrote:         hello,                i just installed redhat 7.2 and i think i have everything   working properly.  anyway i want to install mplayer because i heard it   can play quicktime movs.  i apt-get source mplayer and dl'd it to   /usr/src.              i tried to just rpm --rebuild mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm,   then i get ; mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm: no such file or directory.             any help or a link to some document would be appreciated, thanks  -rob      _______________________________________________  rpm-list mailing list   http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list     _______________________________________________ rpm-list mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

easy_ham,i need to experiment with ripping out all my "sophisticated" cut/paste code.  this is mostly historical accident from dealing with very early versions of tk, and the emacs "cutbuffer", and other wierd junk. you can, too, by hacking upon seditbind.tcl appropriately.  hal devore said:          on fri, 13 sep 2002, "tony" == tony nugent wrote:        tony i can't even mark text in an exmh message window and then     tony paste it into a terminal window, the cut buffer seems to     tony be completely empty (and its previous contents are no     tony longer there either).      brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the x   model(s) of copy and paste.  not in those words... but that   was how i read it. ;)      i have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh    across a vnc link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in    it and vice versa).  as long as i stick to apps being "normally"    displayed on my x server i don't have much of a problem.      my recollection from my x programming days is that the x model,   like everything in x, is more complex than the human brain can   handle.  it also is very different from the ms-windows model.   and i get the feeling that tk tries to "unify" those two models   and fails.  not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the    confusion is, frankly.      --hal               _______________________________________________   exmh-users mailing list   exmh-users@redhat.com   https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users  -- brent welch software architect, panasas inc pioneering the world's most scalable and agile storage network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users   
easy_ham,it's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the "i'll try my damnest to paste something" procedure:  # return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0. proc text_selection {} {     if [catch {selection get} sel] {         if [catch {selection get -selection clipboard} sel] {             if [catch {cutbuffer get 0} sel] {                 return ""             }         }     }     return $sel }  this is in textselection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste. it is that last "cutbuffer get" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only application on the planet that still looks there.  we should probably just disable that - try this variant:  proc text_selection {} {     if [catch {selection get} sel] {         if [catch {selection get -selection clipboard} sel] {             return ""         }     }     return $sel }  everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.   rick baartman said:   i've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. here's th      e    behaviour i have. i have exmh and xemacs windows up, and a terminal window.

easy_ham, "kevin oberman" said:   it did for me, but i am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as   other apps seemed to work ok for cut and paste and tk does its   clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. so i'm not   about to place blame. just reporting my experience.  one more salvo on x and cut/paste.  x specifies at least two *mechanisms* for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  windows and macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  i'm quite sure that tk implements all primary and clipboard selections accurately. the primary selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your x display.  the clipboard selection is the one with the explicit copy step, and is the same as what you have on windows and macintosh. however, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today) by versions of emacs.  exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.  i would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in text_selection and report what works well for them.  we may come up with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  of course, that's an admission of policy failure, but i'm willing to do that.  -- brent welch software architect, panasas inc pioneering the world's most scalable and agile storage network www.panasas.com welch@panasas.com    _______________________________________________ exmh-users mailing list exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users

easy_ham, from:  scott lipcon   date:  mon, 23 sep 2002 17:49:47 -0400   chris,     i'm home now, and this copy of exmh is pretty bad -  i'm running from  cvs on sunday night - the only change since then was the one you made  this morning for "bulletproofing in mhreadseqs".    i run exmh, and i can visably see it count up the number of unseen  messages as it looks through the folders - i have about 3000 unseen  messages in maybe 10 or 12 folders.    it takes a few seconds for all  of the folders in the fcache to turn blue.    this is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little  while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  there is probably  some tuning possible in this area.   in +inbox, i have 4 unread messages.  they aren't blue, they are  white background with a normal colored font.  i changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to  a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen  messages may be in.  i *did* ask brent before i did it.  if you like the old  behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.   if i click on a message, i get the following traceback:    invalid command name "mh_markseen"      while executing  "mh_markseen $exmh(folder) $msgid"      (procedure "hook_msgshow_update_unseen" line 5)      invoked from within  "$cmd $mhprofile(path)/$exmh(folder)/$msgid mimehdr"      (procedure "msgshow" line 23)      invoked from within  "msgshow $msgid"      (procedure "msgchange" line 18)      invoked from within  "msgchange 66 show"      invoked from within  "time [list msgchange $msgid $show"      (procedure "msg_change" line 3)      invoked from within  "msg_change $msgnum $show"      (procedure "msg_pick" line 8)      invoked from within  "msg_pick $lineno show"      (procedure "ftocrangeend" line 12)      invoked from within  "ftocrangeend [lindex [split [.ftoc.t index current] .] 0] 0"      (command bound to event)  this is because of your hook_msgshow_update_unseen which is calling a function  which no longer exists.  i suspect you need  seq_del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid now instead of   mh_markseen $exmh(folder) $msgid   it appears that the message does get marked as seen though, as it  loses the white background, and nmh reports the same.      if i click the flist button, it zero's the unseen count, and then  there is again a visible delay as it counts up all the unseen   messages - maybe 3-4 seconds.    i really think my installation is ok now, but if this behavior is just  really strange i'll blow everything away and reinstall.  i'm happy to  spend some time helping to track this down, i don't really need exmh.  i'm comfortable enough using nmh.    scott        _______________________________________________  exmh-workers mailing list  exmh-workers@redhat.com  https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers  --  chris garrigues                 http://www.deepeddy.com/~cwg/ vircio                          http://www.vircio.com 716 congress, suite 200 austin, tx  78701  +1 512 374 0500    world war iii:  the wrong-doers vs. the evil-doers.    
easy_ham, from:  scott lipcon   date:  mon, 23 sep 2002 22:35:05 -0400   the speed is a problem for sure - it takes a long time to do the  rescanning of sequences (i associate it with hitting the 'flist'  button, or when my background flist goes off).    i'm running on a  pretty fast system (athlon 1700+, 512mb ram, 10k rpm ultra scsi disk)  and hitting flist used to take no more than a second.  the big  difference might just be perception, because the the old code just  updated all the folders (count + color) all at once, instead of making  it look like there is 0 unseen, then counting its way back up.      i doubt i'll have much time in the immediate future to hack at this,  but if i do - can you suggest areas that might be the best to  optimize?   if not, do you think we can put in some preferences to  disable some of the more intensive features?   i'd rather disable all  the sequence support (except unseen, of course) and have reasonable  speed.   i suspect people on slow machines would find the current  state unusable.  if i knew where the problem was, i'd fix it myself.  finding it is probably more work than the actual fix.       this is because of your hook_msgshow_update_unseen which is calling a fun  ctio   n    which no longer exists.      i suspect you need    seq_del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid   now instead of     mh_markseen $exmh(folder) $msgid       thanks.  i'm not sure i'll need it with the new sequence code, but i  might.  does your new code commit sequences immediately?  the old code  didn't, so i put that in to help keep my mh and exmh windows in sync.  yes it does.  chris  --  chris garrigues                 http://www.deepeddy.com/~cwg/ vircio                          http://www.vircio.com 716 congress, suite 200 austin, tx  78701  +1 512 374 0500    world war iii:  the wrong-doers vs. the evil-doers.    
easy_ham, how easy would it be to code a menu item that marks as read all messages   before the current message?  i often have problems reading heavy-traffic   mailing lists in exmh because i want to read only a subset of a lists   messages, but i lose track of where i was in the particular folder.      this could also be coded more generally in the new sequences code as a way to   remove all messages before current from a particular sequence.  easy.  first, you'll have to excuse me as i'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this may not play well with recent changes.  (i did look at 2.5.1, too). and, i just did this off the top of my head (i wanted to see if it (**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.  adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:  *fops.more.m.uentrylist: ketchup *fops.more.m.l_ketchup:  catch-up all b4 cur *fops.more.m.c_ketchup:   my_mark2curseen  then you just need to provide the source for my_mark2curseen and  arrange for exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the "source hook" under prefs-hacking support)  it's going to look something like this:  proc my_mark2curseen {} {     global exmh pick msg     exmh_status "clearing unseen up to cur..." red     mh_setcur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)     set pick(ids) [...get message ids for "pick 1-cur"...]     busy pickmarkseen     exmh_status ok blue }  (that's based upon the guts of pick_markseen)  you need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; i ran out of time!  john  (*) "it just works" (tm) (**) "it" == my head    _______________________________________________ exmh-workers mailing list exmh-workers@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers

easy_ham,i use a mostly red hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my  kernel by hand.  i'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec  that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  i recognize that  freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard red hat in mind,  including a standard kernel rpm.  however, i hope that matthias will  consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.  the diff is attached below.  the first part of the diff contains a  conditional that checks to see if the expected rpm is installed.  if it  is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  if  the expected rpm is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using  "uname -p", while %{krpm} is left undefined.  the second part of the diff is simpler.  we only require that  kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an rpm.  (if  the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have  retained the sources in the expected place.)  again, i realize that i'm operating "off warrantee" by not using a red  hat kernel rpm.  matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not  too ugly, i'd love to see you pick it up.  if not, well at least this  message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.

easy_ham,if anyone here is running (null) beta then you may like these gnome theme packages. they are enhanced and repackages from my previous theme packs, this time to conform to the way pre-release rh8 handles themes for gtk1 and gtk2.  redhat has a preferences - themes app, but themes only show up there that have both gtk1.2 (gnome1) themes and gtk1.4 (gtk2 aka gnome2) themes available. then rh will apply the theme to both gtk versions, so the user does not really notice that different gtk toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.  this "gtk2-engines-compat" rpm has gtk2 ported themes for those themes that are included in the rh package "gtk-engines" themes pack for gtk1.  the "gtk1+2-themez" pack mostly repackages my previous theme rpms in a way that the (null) btea like, and supposedly the next rh8 when released :)  forward - original mail:   from " angles  puglisi"    date 09/01/2002 - 06:10:03 am   subject some (null) eyecandy packages

easy_ham,hi all,  i've decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers. as usual the result is that i've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from that, right? ;-)  i've got the whole thing working on a valhalla system, but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on enigma, limbo/(null) and maybe others, who knows ;-)  here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out : - recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel   (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10) - install this "alsa-driver" package - install the "alsa-libs" package - install the "alsa-utils" package  now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your /etc/modules.conf file to replace the default oss driver loading : http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/ (very complete and very good documentation!) hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)  reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and insert the new ones. if all is well you've got alsa working! ("dmesg" to check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.  with "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. you can also install the xmms plugin (seems to make my xmms segfault on exit... hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3 files... that's it!  it really isn't complicated, and has never been from what i see. the only thing i disliked was to have to install from source... but as i can't imagine myself doing that ;-) i've repackaged everything cleanly. even the /dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly %post script, i insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d structure. there are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided alsa spec files, for example i've split alsa-lib's development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against which the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release, so does the architecture!).  i'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!  download : http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/  current spec files : http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec (all others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )  matthias  ps: as an extra bonus, i've also recompiled xine with alsa support! simply run "xine -a alsa09" and off you go! it may even support 5.1 and s/pdif ;-)  --  clean custom red hat linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/ red hat linux release 7.3 (valhalla) running linux kernel 2.4.18-10 load : 0.57 0.42 0.42, ac on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)  _______________________________________________ rpm-list mailing list  http://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list

easy_ham,blogstart:   **dublin**: something from the archives.    daev walsh forwards an article from the irish digest about ''billy in the bowl''.  this story is also immortalised in an old dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a pogues track.  billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman (where i now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money.  blogend:  linktext: billy in the bowl  from:         daev  subject:      the case of the stoneybatter strangler  a story of my new neighbourhood...   the irish digest july 1964   the case of the stoneybatter strangler  the handsome, deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life   dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class.  this was "billy in the bowl"  the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  seated in this " bowl ", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand.  billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs.  nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face.  this was billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change.  the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along.  he would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.  "billy in the bowl", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money.  the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.  as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk, was falling.  the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street - on dublin's north quays.  when billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane.  as his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.  trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed.  she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.  in a few minutes it was all over.  the woman lay in a dead faint, and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his " bowl ", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket.  an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant.  and, as "billy in the bowl" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar.  again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or  stoneybatter.  on one occasion " billy in "the bowl " tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her.  the incident became known as the 11 grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir.  hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months "billy in the bowl" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  around this period, dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder.  months passed and  "billy in the bowl" reverted once again to his old pasttime.  a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district.  but the beggar still rolled along in his "bowl" pitied and unsuspected.  then came the night that finished billy's career of crime.  two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help.  rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch.  billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch.  she proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.  meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.  the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene.  among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy.  "billy in the bowl" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  the grangegorman-stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night.    daev  _______________________________ rev.  dave 'daev' walsh, daev@fringeware.com home:  http://www.fringeware.com/hell weekly rant: http://www.nua.ie/blather 'is it about a bicycle?'-sgt.pluck,  'the third policeman', by flann o'brien ________________________________ holistic pet detective, owl worrier, snark hunter  ________________________________

easy_ham,there is a whitelist rbl now!  ironport's bonded sender is  basically a whitelist rbl where you post a bond to get on the  list, and then lose the bond if you end up spamming from that ip  address (or something like that).  http://www.bondedsender.org/  c  on sunday, august 25, 2002, at 07:58  pm, bart schaefer wrote:   4. dnsbl: only certifies an ip address, not who is using it. as it is  currently used, dnsbl allows you to look up if some ip address   has been  blacklisted by someone. what i haven't seen is a service that   provides a  dns based whitelist.   there's a practical reason for that:  any dns list (white or   black) works  only for a limited number of ips; the set of unlisted ips is   much larger  than the set in the dns list.  if you have to make a binary decision to  accept or reject, you'll be wrong less often if you reject the   blacklist  and accept everything else, rather than accept the whitelist and reject  everything else.   a whitelist is only helpful when (a) you only want mail from a limited  number of known sources, or (b) you can use a secondary system   like sa to  decide what to do with the vast unlisted masses.  most mtas still make  only the binary decision, because the secondary computation is   expensive.   with sa's cooperation, though, it might be worth a try.  even better if  one could get commercial anti-spam outfits to agree to factor it in.    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: osdn - tired of that same old cell phone?  get a new here for free! https://www.inphonic.com/r.asp?r=sourceforge1&refcode1=vs3390 _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham, i may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize habeus?  to  me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.  you're not dense. i'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of spamassassin. i think they were added to sa quite prematurely. to me it's simple:  1. people who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only bulk-mailing companies like amazon or ebay are going to bother, and i already whitelist them. individuals won't bother.  2. spammers have lots of motivation to forge the habeas headers, and a good percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of habeas.  i think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other potential new rule. when i test against my corpus here's what i get:  overall     spam  nonspam     s/o   score  name   13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)       0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  habeas_swe  the score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a useless rule so far.  -- michael moncur  mgm at starlingtech.com  http://www.starlingtech.com/ "never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake." --napoleon    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: jabber - the world's fastest growing  real-time communications platform! don't just im. build it in!  http://www.jabber.com/osdn/xim _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,guys, the habeas infringers list (hil) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.  please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers.  yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and isps have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  so, i can't understand how daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried.  we can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of.  we can subpoena the records of the isp that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whack-a-mole accounts.  we can use private investigators.  yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  but, they're not secret agents.  they're just trying to make a buck, and habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business  habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before.  given that our whole business plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with "not spam", i can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like sa acting on the habeas warrant mark.  daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation.  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the hil, then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release.  but, you're trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.  at the end of the day, spamassassin is like the club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without sa) rather than yours.  habeas can play the role of lojack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars.  but only if we're given a chance to succeed.            - dan -- dan kohn       -----original message----- from: daniel quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com]  sent: wednesday, august 28, 2002 16:38 to: matthew cline cc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net subject: re: [satalk] o.t. habeus -- why?   matthew cline  writes:   there must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are  planning on making money from the spam.  what a court would consider  evidence of being the spammer is another question.  haha!!!  just a few notes:   - it will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone    in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (china is a    good example) even if they do officially "respect" copyright law.   - law suits take time. between now and conclusion of the first court    case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!   - contact information can change: phone numbers, po boxes, stolen    cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.   - spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  i    don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  also,    some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,    "pump and dump" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly    required for the spammer to get their way.  dan   ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: jabber - the world's fastest growing  real-time communications platform! don't just im. build it in!  http://www.jabber.com/osdn/xim _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: jabber - the world's fastest growing  real-time communications platform! don't just im. build it in!  http://www.jabber.com/osdn/xim _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham, bart schaefer said:   this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all  its incarnations) and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject  at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).    argh, they do not, do they?   the fps must be just gigantic :(   if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,  there'd better be _zero_ fps, because all those filters would drop their  thresholds to 5.  well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that a spam hits 5.0.    any higher does us no good, as it means an fp is a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.  spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works. but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.  --j.   ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,if you need to store a database password, then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree.  you can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere, so that at least an attacker has to get two different things. also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that is granted very limited access.  however, you can often do better than this if security is critical.  create a separate program which has these database keys (as noted above), and make the web program contact it.  create a very limited protocol that only lets you do the operations you need (you can add specific operations later).  there's a performance hit, which you're trading for improved data isolation.    giorgio zoppi wrote:   on fri, aug 23, 2002, david wheeler wrote:     the standard way to store passwords is... not to store passwords.  instead, store a salted hash of the password in a database.  when you get a purported password, you re-salt it, compute the hash, and determine if they are the same.  this is how unix has done it for years.  you want bigger hashes and salts than the old unix systems, and you still want to prevent reading from those files (to foil password crackers). more info is in my book at:    http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs     well...but this cannot be applied to database password, which most  web apps use. the only solution i figure is store in clear outside web  tree, any other ideas feasible?    ciao,  giorgio.    --  never is forever - deneb@penguin.it  homepage: http://www.cli.di.unipi.it/~zoppi/index.html  --         --   --- david a. wheeler      dwheeler@ida.org

easy_ham, software vendors have been trying since forever to prevent software piracy.  remember when you had to enter a specific word from a specific page of the  software manual, which was printed on dark maroon paper so that it could  not be photocopied?  didn't work.  propritery encoding of dvd's?  didn't  work. software that required the use of a registration key?  didn't work.   windows xp was shipped with this supposedly revolutionary method for  stopping piracy, and what happened?  how long was it before the code was  cracked? how many keygens are there for windows xp?  is someone running a  pirated version of xp really going to use windows update to installed a  service pack which breaks their os?  just because m$ didn't include the  change in their readme?  fat chance.  my problem is not the same as ms's one, i don't have to deal with millions of  identical copy of the same cd with propably millions of working keys.  each  download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  the key generator is  a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  if the end users are teenagers,  you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we  think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients  personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible  steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.  i agree with all of you that mass production cds will not be safe from piracy  in a near futur.  that can be seen as a collateral of mass market  penetration.  btw thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  i'm playing with  gdb's dissassembler now but i don't think it's what a typical cracker would  use.  any hints on unix cracking tools ?  thanks.  --  yannick gingras coder for obb : onside brainsick bract http://openbeatbox.org

easy_ham,thank you lars for your reply to my query.   sa doesnt do any of these. it is probably a function of whatever scanning system/mda  you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). what exactly are you using?  i am using spamassassin as part of the mailscanner package (using sendmail as the mta). it integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file with sa. all very neat.   sa in itself does nothing really. you need a frontend (procmail, amavis, etc)  at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message  to sa and do whatever other processing you want.  i thought that sa rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given. i was hoping there were some other actions that i could custom-program in.  again, many thanks,   adrian       ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: osdn - tired of that same old cell phone?  get a new here for free! https://www.inphonic.com/r.asp?r=sourceforge1&refcode1=vs3390 _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham, "kerry nice" said:   what about some reality check rules.  yeah, you can pack in lots of things  into the header to try and get some negative points, but do they all make  sense in combination.  can you have a pine message id in the same header  with an outlook express one or a mutt user-agent?  yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now e.g. check for an outlook-style forwarded message, and not give it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from outlook.   i think the headers should be paid special attention to.  the message  content of something from the ny times or lockergnome might look spammy, but  usually they don't forge or fake anything in the header.  tone down the  negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries.  when we get more (good) "nice" tests, the ga will assign lower scores to them.  i think the current problem is that there are very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the ga a big problem to solve.  --j.   ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: osdn - tired of that same old cell phone?  get a new here for free! https://www.inphonic.com/r.asp?r=sourceforge1&refcode1=vs3390 _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,btw, i've been thinking a little about the rpms and other packages. already the pld guys are distributing 3 rpms:    - perl-mail-spamassassin            the perl modules.    - spamassassin            the "spamassassin" and "spamd" scripts,           spamd rc-file etc.    - spamassassin-tools            mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.           for generating rescore data from corpora.  this seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs the perl modules doesn't need to require the full rpm be installed, with rc files in init.d etc.  it's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.  theo, btw, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the rpm?  --j.   ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: osdn - tired of that same old cell phone?  get a new here for free! https://www.inphonic.com/r.asp?r=sourceforge1&refcode1=vs3390 _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,this is not directly spamassassin related, but more of a general dealing-with-spam issue.  what is the best way to deal with spam during the smtp transaction? there are domains and addresses that i know are spam at the 'mail from' and can deal with at the smtp level. i have been, and i think most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a "permanent" error. that pretty much means, "don't bother to try from that address again, you'll get the same error." people often add cathartic messages to accompany the 550 like, "spammers must die."  but this might not be the best way to go. you are telling the spammers that you are on to them. this may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks. is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail? that is, act like everything is ok during the smtp transaction, but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (this is generally how spamassassin works since almost everyone uses it after the smtp transaction has completed successfully.) spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods.  then there is a third possibility. instead of returning a 550 code indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is saying "mailbox does not exist." this would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from their lists. i know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can lower the incidence.  so, what are the arguments for each? do spammers even look at _any_ of the bounce messages they get? the volume of bounces must be huge. personally, i'm starting to think blackholes are the way to go... but sending back that "spammer die, die, die," or stock "access dee-nied!" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;) --  crist j. clark                     |     cjclark@alum.mit.edu                                    |     cjclark@jhu.edu http://people.freebsd.org/~cjc/    |     cjc@freebsd.org   ------------------------------------------------------- in remembrance www.osdn.com/911/ _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,this is just an semi-educated guess - if i'm wrong, someone please correct me!  spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. since you're calling spamc from a global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). if called as root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.  from the spamc man page:         -u username            this argument has been semi-obsoleted.  to have spamd use            per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config            files spamd should load.  if you're running spamc as some            other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)            then you can still use this flag.   the solution is to set dropprivs=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running spamc. from the procmailrc man page:         dropprivs   if set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges                    it might have had (suid or sgid).  this  is  only                    useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom                    half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on                    behalf of the recipient.   i hope that helps, and i also hope it's right!  st-   | -----original message----- | from: spamassassin-talk-admin@example.sourceforge.net | [mailto:spamassassin-talk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]on behalf of | cheryl l. southard | sent: tuesday, september 24, 2002 2:28 pm | to: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net | subject: [satalk] user_prefs ignored | | | hi all, | | i am running spamassassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent | with sendmail.  i use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from | /etc/procmailrc. | | spamd is run as root with the flags "-d -a -c", and spamc isn't run with | any flags. | | when i was testing the program, i deployed spamc from my personal | ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time. | i can see this because i have a non-default "required_hits" value which | gets reported in every e-mail on the "x-spam-status" line. | | now that i run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my | ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from | e-mails from outside computers.  the "required_hits" value gets set back | to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  however, if i send local | e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly. | | does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or | procmail bug? | | thanks, | | cheryl | | -- | cheryl southard | cld@astro.caltech.edu | | | ------------------------------------------------------- | this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek | welcome to geek heaven. | http://thinkgeek.com/sf | _______________________________________________ | spamassassin-talk mailing list | spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net | https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk |    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mailing list spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk

easy_ham,http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1046      ------- additional comments from spamassassin-contrib@msquadrat.de  2002-10-03 13:57 -------  i've thought about this and pm_filter needs to die. i've now tried    multiple ways to make it just transparently work on 5.00503 and failed.    if anyone has any bright ideas please jump in.      you see anyone upgrading from the cpan shell will get a failure on the line:         use extutils::makemaker 5.45;    quite some modules from cpan do have a line like this nowadays (i think or  read so somewhere, respectively). and the perl error message is very clear:  "extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at  makefile.pl line 2."     because it never gets chance to reach a "writemakefile" line with a    prereq_pm = { extutils::makemaker = 5.45 } option. so the cpan shell    can't automatically upgrade this module. i cannot think of any way    around this.    i could think of a solution: we could remove the "use" line and add the  version to prereq_pm. after writemakefile() we could add the lines    require extutils::makemaker;    extutils::makemaker-version(5.45);  to do per hand what 'use extutils::makemaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl  makefile.pl` will die with a "uncaught exception from user code:  extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at  makefile.pl line 103." there but we've got a makefile. but i don't know if  cpan will run the make anyway...     to add insult to injury, the pm_filter part gets run during pm_to_blib,    which would be fine, except extutils::makemaker doesn't let you write a    my::pm_to_blib - it's non-overridable! so even though we could    potentially copy the 5.45 extutils::install::pm_to_blib code somewhere    into the spamassassin codebase (i tried that first), we can't cause the    makefile to call our code :-(    we could call the preprocessor on install time. that's not a very clean  approach but could work.    we can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the makefile directly per postamble. we  already have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. adding  some commands in this section gives some make warnings ("makefile:933:  warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' makefile:877: warning:  ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'") but does work. not a very good  solution either.     so i'm *strongly* against the current use of extutils::makemaker 5.45    usage (if this were an apache project this would be my veto vote), and    really hope we can find another way.    the "use makemaker::..." error message is imho quite clear, so i think it's ok  to require the user to do a manual update of extutils::makemaker before the sa  installation. but that's just my opinion ;-)    i'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. they should know.     ------- you are receiving this mail because: ------- you are on the cc list for the bug, or are watching someone who is.   ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ spamassassin-devel mailing list spamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel

one that looks at the total area of all of the images in the message (t_html_image_area*), one that looks at the total number of images in the message (t_html_num_imgs*), and one that looks at the longest total run of consecutive images (t_html_consec_img*).  ===============  the total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of html::html_tests(), if an img tag has both the width

whitespace, so there would be a lot of img tags with no plain text (non-whitespace) between them.  so i defined consecutive img tags to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of consecutive imgs within a message.  this one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus there's only a handful of messages with img runs larger than two.    0.450    1.418    0.000

easy_ham,i'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail problem. here's the scenario... my mail server is a 150mhz pc funning freebsd 4.4. ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my wife's web site with apache server running on it and a few other services (jabber, etc). between the various members of our family, we get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). on occasion, our dsl-based isp dies for a number of hours. when we get a reconnection to the internet, i get a huge flow of emails coming in which are then filtered via razor. as a result, i will sometimes see over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an occasion. the machine is then really slow.  i noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated with the call to razor-check. there was something in the log, though, to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor files. so i have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. i haven't had any down time since then so i cannot comment on whether this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (this paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph above; but i thought i should be complete in my description.)  at any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  is there, perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?  any ideas would be welcome.  thanks, joe --- joe berry joe@topshot.com aim "joe topshot" yahoo msgr "joetopshot" jabber "joetopshot@topshot.com" baltimore, md    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by: osdn - tired of that same old cell phone?  get a new here for free! https://www.inphonic.com/r.asp?r=sourceforge1&refcode1=vs3390 _______________________________________________ razor-users mailing list razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users  
easy_ham,see your /etc/sendmail.cf file, there are a number of methods for limiting the number of concurrent sendmail processes, either by load average (i'm sure), or concurrency (i think)... i use sendmail anymore (i use qmail) but i'm sure that if you look in the config file, you will see what you need...  regards, adam   -----original message-----  from: razor-users-admin@example.sourceforge.net  [mailto:razor-users-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]on behalf of joe berry  sent: sunday, 25 august 2002 1:44 pm  to: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net  subject: [razor-users] reducing impact from tons of email    i'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail  problem. here's the scenario... my mail server is a 150mhz pc funning  freebsd 4.4. ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my  wife's web site with apache server running on it and a few other  services (jabber, etc). between the various members of our family, we  get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). on  occasion, our dsl-based isp dies for a number of hours. when we get a  reconnection to the internet, i get a huge flow of emails coming in  which are then filtered via razor. as a result, i will sometimes see  over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an  occasion. the machine is then really slow.   i noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated  with the call to razor-check. there was something in the log, though,  to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor  files. so i have just added "-home /etc/razor" as an argument. i  haven't had any down time since then so i cannot comment on whether  this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount.

easy_ham,the following was personal correspondence between two people.  i can't fathom how razor thinks it is spam:    we are struggling with the decisions related to wether or not to  go ahead with our plans to purchase an ocr and forms  scanning solution.   an outside consultant mentioned that he had heard that not to  long ago you folks were considering implementing ocr  technology to reduce data entry costs and improve efficiency.  if you could let us know if you did move foreward with any  plans in that direction it would be of great help to us. may i ask  what initialy prompted you to consider ocr? did you decide it  could help your compamy? what software did you go with?  would you recomend we take a look at it?  at present we are still planning to continue our research until  we decide which ocr system best suits our needs, then  implement it quickly.   if you are just starting to consider this  technology feel free to stay in touch. we will let you know what  we decide on and if it works for us.   if you cannot advise on this please forward this e-mail to the  proper individual in your company who might be able to help with  this.  thanks,  jay     ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ razor-users mailing list razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users

easy_ham, "fox" said:   before or after i whitelisted all the legit mailing lists that razor is  tagging?  i had one false positive in the last four days.  razor tagged some  guys person-to-person message because he used an ostrich-in-your-face jpeg  that is probably pretty popular on the net, and -lm 4 means any single  attachment in a message that is razored, razors the whole message, if i  understand it correctly.  razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   btw, i notice all my *.conf files in ~/.razor use "lm = 4" by default anyway.   no, i am not keeping official tally of false positives.  i need to write a  html interface to do it, and then it would be easy.  i imagine you want  false positive rate per filter.  i will work on it tomorrow, and maybe in a  week i will have some stats for false positives.  yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers like spam filters, without tracking fps, is not good.   after all, "cat  /dev/null" gets a 100% hit rate, but without the fp rate figure of, let's say 90%, you'd never know it was a bad thing to do ;)  --j.  
easy_ham,gary funck  [2002-09-18 13:57:00 -0700]:  in my experience, there are spam messages that sneak past spam assassin,  that razor will pick up. those are the ones that i'm calling "marginal".  basically, i'm hoping that "the collective" of razor users make a better  judge of spam than any single program like sa can, and therefore i can  benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering. i've  seen examples of this already, where sa doesn't score the spam high enough  to bounce it, but razor does.  i think perhaps you missed the fact that sa scores are adjustable.  if you want sa to tag all messages listed in razor then you can put this in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.    score razor_check 10  the default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5. therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by sa then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5 would be sufficient.  if you are already using sa then the above would be more efficient. otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once for sa and once again afterward.  if you really want to run razor individually then you should set the 'score razor_check 0' so that sa won't do it and avoid the double network hit.  however, one of the benefits of using sa in combination with razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  the current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam. but for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold. razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as razor1.  bob 
easy_ham, i suggest that you use a normal user to start. once you are familiar  enough with razor and understand how it works, try the complex things  like integration with the mta and the like.  ok, but do i have to launch that command as "root" or what?  thank you     ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ razor-users mailing list razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users   
easy_ham,using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives where it shouldn't.  such as an email with a word doc and the signature below.  after looking at the word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, i am convinced it marked the body, which contains no next except the "incredimail advertisment" signature, as spam.  so i have to turn off -lm 4.  razor has been getting other strange emails it shouldn't with -lm 4 on.        see the incredimail ad signature i am talking about below:        fox    ____________________________________________________   incredimail - email has finally evolved - click here    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ razor-users mailing list razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users

easy_ham,i am somewhat puzzled by a phone call i (or rather the cio at the isp for whom i work) received from an individual claiming to represent cloudmark. the gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain information proprietary to cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be required to begin paying cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. i was wondering if anyone else has received such a call?  i am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach (ala brightmail and the likes).  sven    ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsored by:thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ razor-users mailing list razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users   
easy_ham,hi,  i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware. you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. that base image is never altered by a vm instance. instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own "redo" log. future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine.  this is described here (thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html  could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? here is what i imagine.  the physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. for example, your basic web application might have a web server running apache, connected to an application server running some j2ee or .net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.  when someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. e.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. but what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a "delta" or "redo" partition? and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. this base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. this concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)  does anyone do this already? or is this a new concept? or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don't yet know? i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. it would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime.  thanks for any opinions, ben

easy_ham,i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe 13 years ago; there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don't recall its name. it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readonly storage. it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures, which are older still. there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early 1980s if not before.  a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. the written information must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage. a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate.  it does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not. if you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition) must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes, or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. i have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.)   btw, think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raid4 or raid5... i would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use raid, save for shadowing and possibly striping. those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of raid?  glenn everhart   -----original message----- from: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com] sent: tuesday, september 03, 2002 3:04 pm to: webappsec securityfocus.com; secprog securityfocus subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks   hi,  i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware. you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. that base image is never altered by a vm instance. instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own "redo" log. future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine.  this is described here (thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html  could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? here is what i imagine.  the physical architectures of most production client/server systems are layered. for example, your basic web application might have a web server running apache, connected to an application server running some j2ee or .net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.  when someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. e.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. but what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a "delta" or "redo" partition? and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from backup. in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. this base/redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. this concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)  does anyone do this already? or is this a new concept? or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don't yet know? i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. it would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and non-volatile disk images. it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime.  thanks for any opinions, ben   ********************************************************************** this transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law. if you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, distribution, or use of the information contained herein (including any reliance thereon) is strictly prohibited. if you received this transmission in error, please immediately contact the sender and destroy the material in its entirety, whether in electronic or hard copy format. thank you **********************************************************************

easy_ham,the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the universe. too big to decrypt.  my point is there will never be a "safe" key. what i would consider is how long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what is available on the market. if you want to stop the bootleggers do not release the data to the public.  i have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking the key gives away it's secret.  the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take ms-xp for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we needed to reinstall our laptop os? notice the amount of mac's sold after the xp release. these where mostly home users that converted to mac os.  the new audio cd's that have digital copy protection so not play on my computer. does this stop me from copying the cd? no. however it does make me return them and get my money back.  the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.  jef

(i use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the "unchangeable" partitions might be written to for temporary swap space. who knows what windows does internally?)  my point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware raid device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted. if some vendor wished to implement this, they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. the prevention of unauthorized modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this particular product. but there are many other techniques out there to defend application data. but those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could help.  i would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware raid vendor to implement. (i'm just guessing, of course, with no knowledge of how hardware raid works internally.) if anyone knows of such a product, i'd love to hear about it.  ben

(2) the risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).  this   would probably be by a malformed or extremely long string in the key   value, which would presumably lead to either dos or system compromise by   buffer overflow on the client system.  and if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide  open for something nasty here. two other things spring to mind;  1) if anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are  not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects. 2) if anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can  create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the  registry. the result of such a thing is obvious.  if i got this all wrong, i'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell  me where i might have misunderstood.   med venlig hilsen / best regards, -allan jensen  si hoc signum legere potes, operis boni in rebus latinus alacribus et  fructuosis potiri potes!

easy_ham,hi everybody!  i'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgresql).  this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.  the application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.  i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but i have some problem figuring out the right approach.  above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.  a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. the api that i'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always.   i can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, i can use a different database with different  user... argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.  where i can found good documentation about this topic?  there is another approach that i would share with the list, something i  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  after all, i'm a real beginner in secure programming, and i'm here to  learn methods and technics.  first of all, i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  i have to keep them separate from the main server. the right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.  the web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. the small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.  in this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. this is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).  any suggestions?  thank you, mario torre --  please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments. see http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html

easy_ham, forwarded-by: william knowles   http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2002430339,00.html  by paul crosbie sep 16, 2002  virgin's latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the mile high club.  the  130million airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.  but couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.  virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only came into service a few weeks ago.  it is named claudia nine after sexy model claudia schiffer, 32, who launched it in july.  now virgin bosses have asked airbus to build a stronger table.  at first, german engineers responsible for the jet's interior were baffled by the problem.  the table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.  one airbus worker said: "we couldn't work it out. then the penny dropped. it didn't occur to the germans that this might happen. it caused great amusement."  the firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about  200.  a virgin spokeswoman said: "those determined to join the mile high club will do so despite the lack of comforts.  "we don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something that we would encourage because of air regulations."  the new airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan "mine is bigger than yours". virgin is using it on flights to the far east and the us.

easy_ham, forwarded-by: chris wedgwood  from: bert  01. i was so poor growing up...  if i wasn't a boy...  i'd have had     nothing to play with.  02. a girl phoned me the other day and said, "come on over; nobody's     home."  i went over. nobody was home.  03. during sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  just the     other night she called me from a hotel  04. one day i came home early from work...  i saw a guy jogging     naked. i said to the guy, "hey buddy, why are you doing that?"  he     said "because you came home early."  05. it's been a rough day. i got up this morning...  put a shirt on     and button fell off.  i picked up my briefcase, and the handle     came off.  i'm afraid to go to the bathroom.  06. i was such an ugly kid...  when i played in the sandbox, the cat     kept covering me up.  07. i could tell my parents hated me.  my bath toys were a toaster and     radio.  08. i was such an ugly baby...  my mother never breast fed me. she     told me that she only liked me as a friend.  09. i'm so ugly...  my father carries around a picture of the kid who     came with his wallet.  10. when i was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to     my father, "i'm sorry. we did everything we could, but he pulled     through."  11. i'm so ugly...  my mother had morning sickness...  after i was     born.  12. i remember the time that i was kidnapped and they sent a piece of     my finger to my father.  he said he wanted more proof.  13. once when i was lost, i saw a policeman, and asked him to help me     find my parents. i said to him, "do you think we'll ever find     them?" he said,"i don't know kid. there's so many places they can     hide."  14. my wife made me join a bridge club. i jump off next tuesday.  15. i'm so ugly...  i worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how     big i'd get.  16. i went to see my doctor. "doctor, every morning when i get up and     i look in the mirror...  i feel like throwing up; what's wrong     with me?" he said...  "i don't know but your eyesight is perfect."  17. i went to the doctor because i'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping     pills. my doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.  18. with my old man i got no respect. i asked him, "how can i get my     kite in the air?" he told me to run off a cliff.  19. some dog i got. we call him egypt because in every room he leaves     a pyramid. his favorite bone is in my arm.  last night he went on     the paper four times - three of those times i was reading it.  20. one year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.  21. my uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in     the electric chair.

"market      consolidation" means the less artists they have to promote, the less      ultimate dollars they'll spend. the smaller the playlist, the greater the      chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because      that's all you'll be able to find out there.    link[1] discuss[2]  [1] http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/23/133228 [2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/h/8neqcxzap8u6x

easy_ham,url: http://boingboing.net/#85486499 date: not supplied  a new addition to the parodical genre of 419 ("nigerian money laundry scam")  letters from members of the shrub establishment, following up on cheney's  letter[1].       i am the widow of the late president george w. bush of the united states of      america. i am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current      circumstances.       i escaped the united states ahead of death squads with my husband and two      children jenna and frank, moving first to england and then, when my      husband's political enemies took power there, to austria. all of our      wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider      trading, was seized by the new government of the usa under the despotic      regime of (dr.) noam chomsky, except for the contents of a few swiss bank      accounts. these bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds      and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my      children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the      usa and swiss bank regulators. they seized our ranch in crawford, texas and      now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.    link[2] discuss[3] (_thanks, stefan!_)  [1] http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_atrios_archive.html#80547516 [2] http://brainslug.org/archives/000224.html#000224 [3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/h/7zkxnlj3i6da

easy_ham,url: http://boingboing.net/#85485894 date: not supplied  ben hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link  between roman chariots and the space shuttle. it has the ring of something  apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless.       the u.s. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,      8.5 inches. that is an exceedingly odd number. why was that gauge used?      because that's the way they built them in england, and the u.s. railroads      were built by english expatriates.       why did the english build them that way? because the first rail lines were      built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's      the gauge they used.       why did "they" use that gauge? because the people who built the tramways      used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used      that wheel spacing.       so why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? well, if they tried      to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old,      long distance roads in england, because that was the spacing of the wheel      ruts...   snopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually  largely true, albeit subject to interpretation. link[2] discuss[3]  [1] http://www.snopes.com/history/american/gauge.htm [2] http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/001404.html#001404 [3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/h/ibhlzvewnwez
