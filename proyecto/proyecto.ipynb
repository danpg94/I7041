communications and how to market on the internet\\nWhat a Deal  Your total cash investment is just 5000\\n\\nStep 1  If this is the first time you have seen this message\\nand you have not joined in this program before then\\ntake out five US1000 bills total 50 investment and mail\\nout 1000 each to the following people to purchase five\\nGuides on communications  For each Guide that you will\\nbe ordering and buying write out on a sheet of plain white\\npaper your own name address and YOUR OWN EMAIL\\nADDRESS and the number and name of the Guide that\\nyou are buying  Then fold the paper put the 1000 bill\\ninside the sheet of paper insert the paper and 1000 bill\\ninto an envelope address the envelope with the name and\\naddress of the person whose name is shown under each\\nGuide below and mail the envelope by first class or air\\nmail Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the\\nenvelopes  No need to send by registered mail\\n\\nLIST OF FIVE NAMES\\n\\n\\nGUIDE

charge\\n\\nDerrick Nguyen\\t\\n9530 Whitmore St\\t\\nEl Monte CA 91733\\t\\nUSA\\n\\n\\nGUIDE  2 How to Give a Business Presentation\\nOrder Guide  2 for US1000 CASH from\\n\\nTim Fai\\nGPO Box

Social Function\\nOrder Guide  4 for US1000 CASH from\\n\\nChester Waldvogel\\n11 Chestnut Way\\nBerlin MD 21811\\nUSA\\n\\n\\nGUIDE  5 How To Sharpen Your Mind\\nOrder Guide  5 for US1000 CASH from\\n\\nJ Siden\\nKrondikesvagen 54 A\\n83147 Ostersund\\nSweden\\n\\nEND OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES\\n\\nStep 2  These Guides will be emailed to you  Save these\\nGuides on your computers hard disk as other people will be\\nordering these Guides from you paying you for them and\\nyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers\\n\\nStep 3  From the list of names above delete the name and\\naddress of the person shown under GUIDE5 and replace that\\nslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE 4s\\nslot  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown\\nCheck the address again\\n\\nStep 4  Delete name and address under GUIDE 4 and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE 3s slot\\n\\nStep 5  Delete name and address under GUIDE 3 and\\nreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE2s slot\\n\\nStep 6  Delete name and address under GUIDE 2 and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE 1s slot\\n\\nStep 7  Delete name and address under GUIDE 1 and\\nreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS This\\nstep is how your own name and address is entered into the\\nlist of names to receive orders for the Guides Eventually\\nyour own name will go down the list of names until you have\\nreached GUIDE 5 and then be dropped from the list The\\nkey point is that the number of people ordering Guides from\\nyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes\\n\\nStep 8  Once you have completed this new list send out\\nthis new email which shows your name under GUIDE 1 to\\nas many email addresses as possible as many as 100000\\nemails or even more  The greater the number of mailings\\nyou make potentially the greater the number of people who\\nwill order the GUIDE 1 from you  These people will then\\nmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the email\\nshowing your name under GUIDE 2 and so on\\n\\nThis is all you need to do  If you wish to read the rest of\\nthis email message then do so  If not just do the 8 steps\\nshown above Remember the key point is to send out as\\nmany emails as possible in step 8 and to encourage and help\\nthose who purchase the Guides from you to send out\\nemails of their own\\n\\nDo NOT change anything other than what is instructed\\nBecause if you do it will not work for you  Your immediate\\nreaction might be Why not replace all the names on the list\\nwith the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends\\nThat might seem to you like a clever move because new\\nbuyers will be sending their money to these people  But\\nthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit\\nWhat will benefit you most is having people who will send\\nout emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new\\nbuyers If the people you slip into that list arent going to\\nbe sending new emails youre only hurting yourself by\\neffectively closing down the program with your name on\\ntop of the list of the names that you have inserted  There\\nwouldnt be new buyers coming in So your sly maneuver\\nwill gain you exactly zero  Furthermore if you have done\\nthe work and your name has worked its way to further\\ndown the list by then you deserve the rewards and\\nearnings from that effort and it would be unethical for\\nanyone to remove your name for whatever reason  Dont\\ndo it to others Remember honesty reaps the reward\\n\\nYou may have a concern that after sending the total 50 to\\nthe five people on the list that one of the people will just\\ntake your money and not send you the Guide  Well rest\\nassured  As we said above its to our benefit to have you\\nas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find\\nnew buyers  So dont think the people on the list will try to\\ncheat you or to stiff you for 1000  The people on the list\\nwould rather have you working hard because your effort will\\nbenefit them as well as you  Later on when other buyers send\\nyou the order to buy the Guides fulfill your end of the deal\\nby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer  Dont cheat\\nProvide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit\\nEND OF SUMMARY\\n\\nREST OF MESSAGE\\n\\nWith easytouse email tools and optin email success in\\nthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary\\npeople who may not have done any internet marketing before\\nAnd the earnings potential is staggering\\n\\nREAD THIS EMAIL TO THE END \\nfollow what it says   and you will not worry whether a\\nRECESSION is coming or not or whether or not you can\\nafford to buy that new car or home that you have been\\nlooking for  Yes I know what you are thinking I never\\nresponded to one of these before either One day though\\nsomething made me feel You use 50 going to a movie\\nfor 2 hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple\\nmeat at a restaurant  Why the heck not  No matter where\\nyou believe those feelings came from I thank every day\\nthat feeling came over me\\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing\\nhad I not Read on It works  And when you read the Guides\\nYouÔøΩll learn how to become a more effective communicator\\nWhat can be better  A way to improve your selfimage

money coming to you  in a reasonable period\\nof time depending on the collective efforts of yourself and\\nthe others on the list of five\\n\\n\\n Take this entire email with the modified list of names\\nand save it on your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\\nCHANGES  There are 2 methods to get this venture going\\n\\nMETHOD  1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\\n\\n\\nLets say that you start small to see how it goes and that\\nyou and those involved send out only 5000 emails each\\nLets also assume that the mailing receives only a 01\\n110 of 1 response the response could be much better\\nbut lets just say it is only 01 Also many people will\\nsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\\n5000 each\\n\\nOut of your 5000 emails and a 01 response that is only\\n5 orders for Guide  1 Those 5 people who responded also\\nsend out 5000 emails each for a total of 25000 Out of\\nthose 25000 emails only 01 responded with orders\\nThats 25 people who responded and ordered Guide  2\\n\\nThose 25 people mail out 5000 emails each for a total of\\n125000 emails The 01 response to that is 125 orders\\nfor Guide  3 Those 125 people send 5000 emails each\\nfor a total of 625000 emails sent out The 01 response\\nis 625 orders for Guide  4\\n\\nThose 625 people send out 5000 emails each for a total\\nof 3125000 emails The 01 response to that is  3125\\norders for Guide  5 or 31250 at 10 per Guide  This\\nmay seem a small amount to you but remember we used a\\nvery low response rate with a small number of emails being\\nsent out  See what happens if you can get the response rate\\nup just slightly\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 01 income from Guides 1  5 is\\n502501250625031250  39050 as above\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 015 income from Guides 1  5 is\\n75560422031640237300  273795\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 02 income from Guides 1  5 is\\n1001000100001000001000000  1111100\\n\\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\\nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100000\\nemails each or more  From the example above you can see\\nthe power of leveraging that is how much greater is the\\namount of money from a small increase in the response rate\\n\\nThere are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide\\nand counting with thousands more coming online every day\\n\\nMETHOD  2 PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are\\nMany FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on\\nthe internet will get a response We strongly suggest you start\\nwith  Method  1 and add METHOD  2 as you go along\\nFor every 10 you receive all you must do is email the\\nGuide the buyer ordered Always provide same day service\\n\\nThe people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise\\nyou how to get the large number of email addresses that\\nyou need to send the new email containing your name and\\naddress  In return when others buy the Guides from you\\nyou also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to\\ntheir email addresses  This will benefit you because your\\nname would be further down the list and their new buyers\\nwill buy from you  This is no different than customer\\nservice in the retail or the  bricks and mortars business\\n\\nAVAILABLE GUIDES \\nThe reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or\\nsomehow  wrong It is simply about time Time for checks\\nor credit cards to be cleared or approved etc Concealing it\\nis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope\\nand steal it before it gets to you\\n\\nORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY\\nAlways send a single 10 bill US CURRENCY for each\\nGuide  Checks NOT accepted Make sure the cash is hidden\\nby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On one of\\nthose sheets of paper write the NUMBER  the NAME\\nof the Guide you are ordering YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS\\nand your name and postal address  Be sure to

instructions\\n\\n\\nPARENTS OF 15  YEAR OLD  FIND 71000 CASH HIDDEN IN\\nHIS CLOSET\\n\\nDoes this headline look familiar Of course it does You most likely have\\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program USA\\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods \\nNew Zealand His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15yearold\\nsons closet Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash Fivedollar bills twenties\\nfifties and hundreds  all neatly rubberbanded in labelled piles\\n\\nMy first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the 41yearold\\nwoman There was over 71000 dollars in that bag thats more than my\\nhusband earns in a year\\n\\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the cardealership where\\nhe worked to tell him what she had discoveredHe came home right away\\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up  Little did\\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\\nactually finding it in the closet\\n\\nAs it turns out the boy had been sending out via Email a type of \\nReport to Email addresses that he obtained off the Internet Everyday\\nafter school for the past 2 months he had been doing this right on his\\ncomputer in his bedroom\\n\\nI just got the Email one day and I figured what the heck I put my name\\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out says the clever\\n15yearold\\n\\nThe Email letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\\n5 dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top\\nand move the others addresses Down  and finally to add your name to\\nthe top of the list\\n\\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\\ndollars in fivedollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\\nname at the top of the 5address list I get junk Email all the time and\\nreally did not think it was going to work the boy continues\\n\\nWithin the first few days of sending out the Email the Post Office Box\\nthat his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptions\\nbegan to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing 5 bills\\n\\nAbout a week later I rode my bike down to the post office and my box\\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it There was also a\\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the post office counter I thought I\\nwas in trouble or something laughs He goes on I went up to the\\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me I had to ride back\\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all  Over\\nthe next few weeks the boy continued sending out the Email  The\\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\\ncloset barely had time for my homeworkHe had also been riding his bike\\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties \\nfifties and hundreds\\n\\nI didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack I would usually tell the\\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\\nmoney and he was outside waiting for meOne time the lady gave me a\\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\\nand my dad would have to come in and do it but I just rode to the next\\nbank down the street laughs  Surprisingly the boy did not have any\\nreason to be afraidThe reporting news \\n\\nteam examined and investigated the socalled chainletter the boy was\\nsending out and found that it was not a chainletter at allIn fact it was\\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws Title 18\\nSection 1302 and 1341 or Title 18 Section 3005 in the US code also in\\nthe code of federal regulations Volume 16 Sections 255 and 436 which\\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received\\n\\nEvery fivedollar bill that he received contained a little note that read\\nPlease send me report number XYXThis simple note made the letter\\nlegal because he was exchanging a service A Report on howto for a \\nfivedollar fee\\n\\nThis is the end of the media release If you would like to understand how\\nthe system works and get your 71000  please continue reading What \\nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net \\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO  just follow the simple instructions\\n\\n\\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR Before you\\nsay Bull please read the following This is the letter you have been\\nhearing about on the news lately Due to the popularity of this letter on the\\n Internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\\nshow to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really\\ncan make people money The show also investigated whether or not the\\nprogram was legal Their findings proved once and for all that there are\\nabsolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\\npeople can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some\\nmegabucks with only 25 out of pocket cost\\n\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY  RESPECT THIS\\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\\nTHAN EVER\\n\\n\\nNote follow the directons below I had best results the second time when\\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions\\n\\nIn order for all of us to be successful many many emails must be sent so\\nthat the returns are many I have been extremely successful using the\\nfollowing company They send out the offers and all I do is accept money\\nfor reports then I send back to the people as soon as possible\\n\\nThis is what one had to say Thanks to this profitable opportunity I was \\napproached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so glad I\\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\\neffort and money required To my astonishment I received total\\n61047000 in 21 weeks with money still coming in\\n\\nPam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey\\n\\n\\nHere is another testimonial This program has been around for a long time \\nbut I never believed in it But one day when I received this again in the\\nmail I decided to gamble my 25 on it I followed the simple instructions\\nand walaa  3 weeks later the money started to come in First month I\\nonly made 24000 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\\n29000000 So far in the past 8 months by reentering the program I\\nhave made over 71000000 and I am playing it again The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\\nanything More testimonials later but first\\n\\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\\n\\n Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \\nFor each report send 5 CASH THE NAME  NUMBER OF THE \\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE\\nSURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT\\n CORNER in case of any mail problems\\n\\n When you place your order make sure you order each of the 5 reports\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer\\nWithin a few days you will receive vie email each of the 5 reports from\\nthese 5 different individuals Save them on your computer so they will be\\naccessible for you to send to the 1000s of people who will order them from\\nyou Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\\nsomething happens to your computer\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT  DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next\\nto each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is\\ninstructed below in step 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of\\nyour profits Once you understand the way this works you will also see\\nhow it does not work if you change it Remember this method has been\\ntested and if you alter it will NOT work People have tried to put their\\nfriendsrelatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money\\nBut it does not work this way Believe us we all have tried to be greedy\\nand then nothing happened So Do Not try to change anything other than\\nwhat is instructed Because if you do it will not work for you Remember\\nhonesty reaps the reward\\n\\n\\n1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and\\nREMOVE the name  address of the person in REPORT  5 This person\\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune\\n2 Move the name  address in REPORT  4 down TO REPORT 5\\n3 Move the name  address in REPORT  3 down TO REPORT 4\\n4 Move the name  address in REPORT  2 down TO REPORT 3\\n5 Move the name  address in REPORT  1 down TO REPORT 2\\n6 Insert YOUR name  address in the REPORT  1 Position\\n\\n\\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name  address ACCURATELY\\n\\n\\n\\n Take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on\\nyour computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a\\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data To assist you with marketing\\nyour business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\\nemails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going\\n\\n\\nMETHOD 1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\\n\\n\\n\\nLets say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5000emails each Lets\\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 02 response the response\\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 02 Also many people\\nwill send out hundreds of thousands emails instead of only 5000 each\\nContinuing with this example you send out only 5000 emails\\n\\n\\nWith a 02 response that is only 10 orders for report  1 Those 10\\npeople responded by sending out 5000 email each for a total of 50000\\nOut of those 50000 emails only 02 responded with orders That equals\\n100 people responded and ordered Report  2\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5000 emails each for a total of 500000 emails\\nThe 02 response to that is 1000 orders for Report 3\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5000 emails each for a total of 5 million\\nemails sent out The 02 response to that is 10000 orders for Report 4\\n\\nThose 10000 people send out 5000 emails each for a total of\\n50000000 50 million emails The 02 response to that is 100000\\norders for Report 5 THATS 100000 ORDERS TIMES\\n5 EACH50000000 half million Your total income in this example is\\n1 50 2500  35000  4 50000  5 500000\\nGrand Total55555000\\n\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\nCALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY\\n\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment\\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\\nmailed 100000emails each or more There are over 150 million people on \\nthe Internet worldwide and counting Believe me many people will do just\\nthat and more\\n\\n\\nMETHOD 2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\\nFREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\\neasily get a larger response\\n\\n\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method 1 and add METHOD 2 as\\nyou go along For every 5 you receive all you must do is email them the\\nReport they ordered Thats it Always provide same day service on all\\norders This will guarantee that the email they send out with your name\\nand address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\\nreceive the report\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY Notes Always\\nsend 5 cash US CURRENCY for each Report Checks NOT\\naccepted Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil On one of those sheets of paper Write\\nthe NUMBER  the NAME of the Report you are

until\\nyou do\\n\\n Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report 2 YOU CAN\\nRELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will\\ncontinue to roll in THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a Different\\nreport You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS AND START\\nTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT to the income you\\ncan generate from this business\\n\\n\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS\\nPROGRAM You have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A\\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT You can make more money in the next few\\nweeks and months than you have ever imagined Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change it in any way It works\\nexceedingly well as it is now\\n\\nRemember to email a copy of this exciting report after you have put your\\nname and address in Report1 and moved others to 2 thru 5 as\\ninstructed above One of the people you send this to may send out\\n100000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them\\nRemember though the more you send out the more potential customers\\nyou will reach So my friend I have given you the ideas information \\nmaterials and opportunity to become financially independent \\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW\\n\\n MORE TESTIMONIALS \\nMy name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an\\naccountant with a major US Corporation and I make pretty good money\\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \\njunk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of the\\npopulation and percentages involved I knew it wouldnt work Jody\\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\\nwith both feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old \\nI told you so on her when the thing didnt work Well the laugh was on\\nme Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45\\ndays she had received total  14720000all cash I was shocked\\nI have joined Jody in her hobby\\n\\nMitchell Wolf Chicago Illinois\\n\\n\\nNot being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my\\nmind to participate in this plan But conservative that I am I decided that\\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\\nwouldnt get enough orders to at least get my money back I was\\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\\norders I made 31921000 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about\\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live There simply isnt a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big\\n\\nDan Sondstrom Alberta Canada\\n\\n\\nI had received this program before I deleted it but later I wondered if I\\nshould have given it a try Of course I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy so I had to wait until I was emailed again by someone\\nelse11 months passed then it luckily came again I did not delete\\nthis one I made more than 490000 on my first try and all the money\\ncame within 22 weeks\\n\\nSusan De Suza New York NY\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this program contact the Office\\nof

is ok that I send you this If you arent interested just \\nsimply delete it \\nREAD THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy \\nweekly paycheck Make more in a few months than last year at work \\nBelieve it work it \\nThis really works dont make the same mistake I made I deleted this \\n45 times before finally giving it a try Within 2 weeks the orders \\nmoney \\nstarted coming in just like the plan below said it would Give it a \\ntry \\nYou will be glad you did \\nThanks and Good Luck You wont need luck just keep reading Dont \\ndelete this \\n \\nFirst read about how a 15 year old made 71000 See below \\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV This is the media report \\nPARENTS OF 15  YEAR OLD  FIND 71000 CASH HIDDEN \\nIN HIS CLOSET \\nDoes this headline look familiar Of course it does \\nYou most likely have just seen this story recently \\nfeatured on a major nightly news program USA \\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world including my neck \\nof the woods  New Zealand His mother was cleaning \\nand putting laundry away when she came across a large \\nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath \\nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her \\n15yearold sons closet \\nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got \\nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash \\nFivedollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds  \\nall neatly rubberbanded in labeled piles \\nMy first thought was that he had robbed a bank \\nsays the 41yearold woman There was over 71000 \\ndollars in that bag  thats more than my husband \\nearns in a year \\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the \\ncardealership where he worked to tell him what she \\nhad discovered He came home right away and they \\ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up \\nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from \\nwas more shocking than actually finding it in \\nthe closet \\nAs it turns out the boy had been sending out via \\nEmail a type of Report to Email addresses that he \\nobtained off the Internet Everyday after school for \\nthe past 2 months he had been doing this right on his \\ncomputer in his bedroom \\nI just got the Email one day and I figured what the \\nheck I put my name on it like the instructions said \\nand I started sending it out says the clever \\n15yearold \\nThe Email letter listed 5 addresses and contained \\ninstructions to send one 5 dollar bill to each person \\non the list then delete the address at the top and \\nmove the others addresses down and finally to add \\nyour name to the top of the list \\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive \\nseveral thousand dollars in fivedollar bills within 2 \\nweeks if you sent out the letter with your \\nname at the top of the 5address list I get junk \\nEmail all the time and really did not think it was \\ngoing to work the boy continues \\nWithin the first few days of sending out the Email \\nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him \\nfor his videogame magazine subscriptions began to \\nfill up with not magazines but envelopes containing \\n5 bills \\nAbout a week later I rode my bike down to the post \\noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 \\nenvelops stuffed in it There was also a yellow slip \\nthat said I had to go up to the post office counter \\nI thought I was in trouble or something laughs He \\ngoes on I went up to the counter and they had a \\nwhole box of more mail for me I had to ride back \\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not \\ncarry it all \\nOver the next few weeks the boy continued sending \\nout the Email The money just kept coming in and I \\njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet \\nbarely had time for my homework He had also \\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his \\narea and exchanging the 5 bills for twenties fifties \\nand hundreds \\nI didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept \\nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a \\ntime in my backpack I would usually tell the lady at \\nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to \\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me \\nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and \\ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and \\nmy dad would have to come in and do it but I just \\nrode to the next bank down the street laughs \\nSurprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be \\nafraid The reporting news team examined and \\ninvestigated the socalled chainletter the boy was \\nsending out and found that it was not a chainletter \\nat all In fact it was completely legal according to \\nUS Postal and Lottery Laws Title 18 Section 1302 and \\n1341 or Title 18 Section 3005 in the US code also \\nin the code of federal regulations Volume 16 \\nSections 255 and 436 which state a product or service \\nmust be exchanged for money received \\nEvery fivedollar bill that he received contained a \\nlittle note that read Please send me report number \\nXYXThis simple note made the letter legal because he \\nwas exchanging a service A Report on howto for a \\nfivedollar fee \\nThis is the end of the media release If you would \\nlike to understand how the system works and get your \\n71000  please continue reading What appears below \\nis what the 15 year old was sending out on the net  \\nYOU CAN USE IT TOO  just follow the simple \\ninstructions \\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET  \\n \\nYou will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your \\nhome \\nBefore you say Bull please read the following This is the \\nletter you have been hearing about on the news lately Due to the \\npopularity of this letter on the Internet a national weekly news \\nprogram \\nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program \\ndescribed below to see if it really can make people money The show \\nalso \\ninvestigated whether or not the program was legal \\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely NO \\nLaws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow \\nthe simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \\n25 out of pocket cost \\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY  RESPECT THIS \\nPROGRAM HAS \\nATTAINED IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER \\nThis is what one had to say  Thanks to this profitable opportunity \\nI was approached many times before but each time I passed on it I am so \\nglad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for \\nthe minimal effort and money required To my astonishment I received \\ntotal \\n61047000 in 21 weeks with money still coming in \\nPam Hedland Fort Lee New Jersey \\n\\nHere is \\nanother testimonial  this program has been around for a \\nlong time but I never believed in it But one day when I received this \\nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my 25 on it I followed the \\nsimple instructions and wallaa  3 weeks later the money started to \\ncome \\nin First month I only made 24000 but the next 2 months after that \\nmade a total of 29000000 So far in the past 8 months by reentering \\nthe \\nprogram I have made over 71000000 and I am playing it again The \\nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \\nanything More testimonials later but first \\n PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE  \\n\\n \\nIf you would like to make at least 500000 every 4 to 5 months easily \\nand comfortably please read the followingTHEN READ IT AGAIN and \\nAGAIN \\n\\n \\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL \\nDREAMS WILL COME \\nTRUE GUARANTEED \\nINSTRUCTIONS \\nOrder all 5 reports shown on the list below \\n \\nFor each report send 5 CASH THE NAME  NUMBER OF THE REPORT \\nYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS to the person whose \\nname appears ON THAT LIST next to the report MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN \\nADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail \\nproblems \\n When you place your order make sure you order each of the 5 \\nreports \\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer \\nand resell them YOUR TOTAL COST 5 X 52500 \\nWithin a few days you will receive via email each of the 5 reports \\nfrom these 5 different individuals Save them on your computer so they will \\nbe

\\nIMPORTANT  DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed \\nnext to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other \\nthan what is instructed below in step  1 through 6  or you will \\nloose out on majority of your profits Once you understand the way this \\nworks you will also see how it does not work if you change it Remember \\nthis \\nmethod has been tested and if you alter it will NOT work  People \\nhave tried to put their friendsrelatives names on all five thinking they \\ncould get all the money But it does not work this way Believe us we all \\nhave tried to be greedy and then nothing happened So Do Not try to change \\nanything other than what is instructed Because if you do it will not \\nwork for you \\nRemember honesty reaps the reward \\n1 After you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement \\nand REMOVE the name  address of the person in REPORT 5 \\nThis person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting \\ntheir fortune \\n2 Move the name  address in REPORT  4 down TO REPORT  5 \\n3 Move the name  address in REPORT  3 down TO REPORT  4 \\n4 Move the name  address in REPORT  2 down TO REPORT  3 \\n5 Move the name  address

list of names and save it \\non your computer DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES \\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data To assist \\nyou with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you \\npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which \\nincludes how to send bulk emails legally where to find thousands of \\nfree \\nclassified ads and much more There are 2 Primary methods to get this \\nventure going \\nMETHOD  1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY \\n\\n \\nLets say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and \\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5000 emails each \\nLets also assume that the mailing receive only a 02 response the \\nresponse \\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 02 Also many \\npeople will send out hundreds of thousands emails instead of only 5000 \\neachContinuing with this example you send out only 5000 emails \\nWith a 02 response that is only 10 orders for report  1 \\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5000 email each for a total \\nof 50000 \\nOut of those 50000 emails only 02 responded with orders Thats100 \\npeople responded and ordered Report  2 \\nThose 100 people mail out 5000 emails each for a total of 500000 \\nemails The 02 response to that is 1000 orders for Report  3 \\nThose 1000 people send out 5000 emails each for a total of 5 \\nmillion emails sent out The 02 response to that is 10000 orders \\nfor Report  4 Whose 10000 people send out 5000 emails each for a \\ntotal of \\n50000000 50 million emails The 02 response to that is 100000 \\norders for \\nReport  5 THATS 100000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH50000000 half \\nmillion \\nYour total income in this example is 1 50  2 500 \\n 35000  4 50000  5 500000  Grand \\nTotal55555000 \\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE \\nWORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \\nCALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL \\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY  \\n\\n \\nREMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING \\nOUT \\nOF 5000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think for a moment what would happen if \\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100000emails \\neach or more There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide \\nand counting Believe me many people will do just that and more \\nMETHOD  2  BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \\n\\n \\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are \\nhundreds of FREE places to advertise Placing a lot of free ads on the \\nInternet will easily get a larger response We strongly suggest you \\nstart with Method  1and add METHOD  2 as you go along For every 5 you \\nreceive all you must do is email them the Report they ordered Thats \\nit Always provide \\nsame day service on all orders \\nThis will guarantee that the email they send out with your \\nname and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise \\nuntil they receive the report \\nAVAILABLE REPORTS \\n \\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY Notes Always \\nsend \\n5 cash US CURRENCY for each Report Checks NOT accepted Make sure \\nthe cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper On \\none of those sheets of paper Write the NUMBER  the NAME of the Report you \\nare ordering \\nYOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address \\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW  \\n\\n \\nREPORT

YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES \\n \\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success \\n If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report 1 within 2 \\nweeks continue sending emails until you do \\n After you have received 10 orders 2 to 3 weeks after that you \\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT  2 If you did not continue \\nadvertising or sending emails until you do \\n Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report  2 YOU CAN \\nRELAX because the system is already working for you and the cash will \\ncontinue to roll in  THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER Every time your \\nname \\nis moved down on the list you are placed in front of a Different report \\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \\npeople are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME \\nSEND \\nANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS \\nAGAIN There is NO \\nLIMIT to the income you can generate from this business  \\n\\n \\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM \\nYou have just received information that can give you financial freedom \\nfor the rest of your life with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT \\nYou can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have \\never imagined Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED Do Not change \\nit \\nin \\nany way It works exceedingly well as it is now \\nRemember to email a copy of this exciting report after you have put \\nyour name and address in Report 1 and moved others to 2  5 \\nas \\ninstructed above One of the people you send this to may send out \\n100000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them \\nRemember \\nthough the more you send out the more potential customers you will \\nreach So \\nmy friend I have given you the ideas information materials and \\nopportunity to become financially independent IT IS UP TO YOU NOW  \\n MORE \\nTESTIMONIALS \\n My name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in Chicago I am an \\naccountant with a major US Corporation and I make pretty good \\nmoney When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \\njunk mail I made fun of the whole thing spouting my knowledge of \\nthe population and percentages involved I knew it wouldnt work Jody \\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in \\nwith \\nboth feet I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old \\nI told you so on her when the thing didnt work Well the laugh was \\non me \\nWithin 3 weeks she had received 50 responses Within the next 45 days she \\nhad \\nreceived total  14720000  all cash I was shocked  I have \\njoined \\nJody in her hobby \\nMitchell Wolf MD Chicago Illinois \\n\\n  Not \\nbeing the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my \\nmind to participate in this plan But conservative that I am I decided \\nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that \\nI \\nwouldnt get enough orders to at least get my money back  I was \\nsurprised \\nwhen I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders I made \\n31921000 in the first 12 weeks The nice thing about this deal is \\nthat it does not matter where people live There simply isnt a better \\ninvestment \\nwith a faster return and so big \\nDan Sondstrom Alberta Canada \\n\\n  I had \\nreceived this program before I deleted it but later I \\nwondered if I should have given it a try Of course I had no idea who \\nto contact  to get another copy so I had to wait until I was emailed \\nagain by someone else11 months passed then it luckily came \\nagainI did not delete this one I made more than 490000 on my \\nfirst try and all the money came within 22 weeks \\nSusan De Suza New York NY \\n\\n \\n It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \\nlittle cost to you I followed the simple instructions carefully and \\nwithin 10 days the money started to come in My first month I made \\n2056000 and by the end of third month my total cash count was  \\n36284000 Life is beautiful Thanx to internet \\nFred Dellaca Westport New Zealand \\n\\nORDER \\nYOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO \\nFINANCIAL

site written or placed by you or under your control \\nDOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti However the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations namely the DOM and sister nation the Kingdom of EnenKio the Marshallese name for Wake Island claiming to represent the midPacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France Presse The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation \\nA Honolulubased attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed httpwwwgoldhavencomissue4Twohtm disconnected as of 2100 \\nThe purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio I am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading the article is As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction For your convenience your text will be set off with  in color DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti Comment The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti in which case a reader may be misled \\nCorrection DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific 1000 \\nmiles south of Tahiti and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific However the Marshall Islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations  \\nComment Just because the RMI government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of EnenKio does that make it true Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government \\nnamely the DOM and sister nation the Kingdom of EnenKio the Marshallese name for Wake Island \\nComment Nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for DOM but as for the Kingdom we dont even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign His Majesty King Remios the sovereign of EnenKio and EneenKio Atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism Doesnt anybody check sources anymore \\nCorrection The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and \\nthe same could be said for DOM \\nclaiming to represent the midPacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France Presse Comment The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio who are forced to live in exile from EneenKio Atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years Furthermore an article in Agence FrancePresse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government My preceding comments apply The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio but also will positively impact people around the globe In fact we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism Doesnt anybody check sources anymore \\nThe Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation \\nComment The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no fraudulent claims of which I am aware and in my post I am responsible for all published information I would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect However my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source Furthermore the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 13 of the land in the Marshall Islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism A Honolulubased attorney created the Kingdom of EnenKio in the early 1990s \\nComment Mr Moore is not an Attorney though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s \\nCorrection The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the \\nowner of EneenKio Atoll aka Enenkio Halcyon Disclerta Wake and 68 other names Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls he passed away in December 1998 and was fully recognized by the RMI government He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994 whereupon the people chose him as their King over EneenKio Atoll ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel sic Hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf \\nCorrection The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made \\npossible by Murjels appointment of Mr Robert Moore the adopted brother of Hermios Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from EneenKio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios and the peoples behalf \\nThe Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed Comment Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an agreement The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over EneenKio Atoll which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of EneenKio Atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979 nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of EneenKio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible

24 1998 Fantasy Island disconnected as of 2100 Response to the author I am unable to locate the Melchizedek press release you cited indicating that Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of EnenKio Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands Further more Melchizedek DOM is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government \\nThe Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September 1997 but it did not convey a lease of land It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments However a prior agreement signed in May 1997 which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio transferred Mr Robert Moores rights to develop Taongi from Mr Moore to DOM It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence This was made possible because Mr Moore is the Alab one class of landowner of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll from the principal landowner Iroijlaplap Paramount Chief Murjel Hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction Consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by Mr Moore who is also the adopted brother of Hermios Now please understand that while Mr Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and development of Taongi which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios Mr Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio Iroijlaplap Hermios also wore he died in December 10 1998 the

you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is another onlyin cyberspace country as you did in the above article is not only a completely and categorically false statement but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio And it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios the sovereign of EnenKio and EneenKio Atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your

Wake Island in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific After the Marshalls became a US Trust Territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll called Enenkio locally The US government has consistently ignored these claims The protests took a sharper turn after the US Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawaii King Murjel Hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls declared Wake Islands independence in 1987 The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek Comment With all candor I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest unless your site is intended as some twisted joke which I am assuming is not the case in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio I am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading your summary is As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction For your convenience your text will be set off with  in color \\nIn 1898 the United States annexed Wake Island in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific \\nCorrection In 1898 the United States invaded Wake Island the \\nnorthernmost atoll  actually named EneenKio centuries before western explorers arrived  of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean The Author responds Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory After the Marshalls became a US Trust Territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll called Enenkio locally Correction Following WWII the Trust Territories of the Pacific which included the Marshall Islands was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations While EneenKio was well established as one of the Marshalls the US only knew it as Wake and having lost many US lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders kept control of it In 1993 the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clans historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of EneenKio Atoll \\nThe Author responds I dont see much conflict between the two versions here \\nThe US government has consistently ignored these claims Correction The US government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979 and from the former traditional landowners including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios The Author responds I will note this The protests took a sharper turn after the US Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawaii Correction The EneenKio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the US Congress when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii by a group of American businessmen and US Marines and in the following year returned the island of Kahoolawe to the Hawaiian People King Murjel Hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls declared Wake Islands independence in 1987 Correction King Murjel Hermios who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998 declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994 whereupon the people chose him as their King over EneenKio Atoll ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy \\nThe Author responds I will make the necessary corrections here The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek \\nCorrection After the death of the First Monarch his brother Remios \\nsucceeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother Crown Prince Lobadreo over the Kingdom of EnenKio today To continue the commentary The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets But that

United States government admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in taking possession of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany\\xa0 The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese\\xa0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on Marshallese society have not healed Thus a current state of adversity exists\\xa0 Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island the government of EnenKio on behalf of the Marshallese King issued the State of War a Declaration and broadcast it to the world\\xa0 The people

In retrospect the Declaration has had little visible effect\\xa0 While a state of adversity does exist the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon\\xa0 The Kingdom of

Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century were found to have a welldeveloped societal structure Many nations have since mostly by force prevailed over the Marshall Islands imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal

with your specific questions or concerns For your advice the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim

occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios to resolve the virtual state of war that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations \\nThe Kingdom does not pretend to be quoting from the report asserting authority over land within the geographical and political boundaries of the RMI We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of EneenKio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be reestablish there As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation

\\nSubject Issuance of Gold Stamps \\nThe government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps This announcement made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp Coin and Postcard Show May 4th was the first prepublication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997 First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official First Day of Issue by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release Distributors dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list \\nBACKGROUND  The Kingdom was established in March 1993 and the government was chosen by the people who then ratified the constitution in September 1994 However due to US military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces the government of the Kingdom lingers in exile Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe South America USA and elsewhere \\nA NATION IN CONFLICT  The land in question commonly known as Wake Island is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them Wake Wilkes and Peale Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll EneenKio lived in the Marshall Islands exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site By way of developing the atoll as a nation the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to Wake atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy \\nSTATE OF WAR  By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top US officials the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual state of war now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States Calls to end US operations vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears Despite repeated notices letters and legal advertising all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government INAUGURAL ISSUE  The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears For that reason the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency However the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world Note Stamps are printed on paper stock do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money \\nCLOSING COMMENTS  The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region In doing so it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly The proceeds from the sale of Gold

United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898 and again in1899 Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships en route to the Philippines on war missions and subsequent Congressional action were the sole basis of the US claim The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East Such a station was never established at Wake Island It was destined to become a military installation \\nHowever formal protests of the seizure was sent to the US President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed But since the US abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War the objections fell into oblivion It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued The US did not establish a settlement there until under a lease in 1934 the CAA predecessor of the FAA allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of transpacific seaplanes Clearly the socalled annexation by the US is grossly flawed the occupation patently illegal and its ownership is held therefore to be wholly invalid When the US Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the US Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the natives of Hawaii a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island The islands of EneenKio as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more hospitable islands of the Marshall group While not being used for Navy target practice as Kahoolawe was the use of the islands of EneenKio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy devoid of scrutiny oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries natives continued to use EneenKio authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap Paramount Chief King Murjel Hermios holds that title today By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island The US cannot produce a title The Hermios ancestral lineage passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers who gave the atoll its Marshallese name their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership \\nUpon the basis of events and actions by the United States the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio by virtue of the Declaration yields to the recognition that a State of War exists over the island nation This is not however to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom over all other claims is forthrightly reasserted The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of US ownership and occupation Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights In the Declaration demands are made as follows ¬ª ¬ª to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable \\naccord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR ¬ª ¬ª If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens \\n¬ª ¬ª to cease and desist effective immediately all and\\nevery \\naction of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200mile Exclusive Economic Zone \\n¬ª ¬ª to pay that certain debt perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior ¬ª ¬ª to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTYSEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice No 97US03 dated March 10 1997 for which it is obligated to pay ¬ª ¬ª That the Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process \\nThe government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly Appeals are being made to the United Nations News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE ÔøΩTOP OF PAGE \\nFebruary 6 1995 News Release \\nOn behalf of His Majesty King Murjel Hermios Monarch of EnenKio Atoll titular head of State Paramount Chief Iroijlaplap of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting  Yokwe The purpose of this notice is twofold First to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known then failed to take action Second to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue As long as you remain quiet safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent your anonymity and that of your publication is well served Summary of Events 199394 Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean EnenKio formerly known as Wake Island The first was issued on February 25 1994 It followed two announcements 1 officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB Hawaii said in articles published New Years Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October 1994 \\n2 US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island part of the star wars program I am led to believe \\nAn emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence thus seeking selfrule under the natural landowner as king Letters to Mr Clinton members of Congress US Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio Wake I Peale I Wilkes I denounced the Armys socalled no significant impact scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds and asserted rightful ownership claims \\nOn March 21 1994 a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios who had granted special power of attorney to Mr Robert Moore appointed Minister Plenipotentiary The Constitution Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted On September 30th a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens believing as did the USA founding fathers that such power was an inherent right of the people It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation it acknowledged His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government \\nDocuments and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions Formal documents of recognition were presented offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations UN Security Council NATO South Pacific Commission and others Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council On October 10th a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17 1899 seizure under force of arms of the islands of EneenKio Atoll the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands Public Law 99239 January 14 1986 Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time the US is now in default under commercial law owing in excess of US100 million The second official press release was issued on November 21 1994 relating the preceding events Of all the agencies to whom it was sent only two the Marshall Islands Journal a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story then only briefly \\nRequest for Media Response \\nThe thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity to before the birth of Jesus worth a little journalistic investigation How about suspicions of insidious militarysanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of world leadership Or is it world domination People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you the media in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage \\n1 Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by US expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of EneenKio Atoll then being utilized by sailors hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco Note These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record not a fabrication \\n2 Investigate andor verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and US policy past and present or the lack thereof with regard to the role of EnenKio  Note It is my understanding Wake was decommissioned after the socalled processing of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s \\n3 Reflect on the contrasting history of US occupation war technological advances in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind \\n4 Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the kings claim of allodial title the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to selfdetermination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner \\n5 Bring to light US strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation offensivedefensive weapon systems clandestine military research environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there Note Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects \\n6 Fully disclose to the people of the United States US strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to EneenKio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via timehonored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for Human rights protected under international law United Nations Charter and conventions and the US Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century Note US apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island Kahoolawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens \\nParting Shot \\nWhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the US federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the US federal government Our nottoodistant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago If this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of American attempts at fixing up the world The title of ownership and inheritance of EneenKio Atoll predates formation of the United States by two centuries or more It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to selfdetermination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor People have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them In conclusion I reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of US political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of Godgiven individual rights Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry \\nTOP OF PAGE\\nNovember 21 1994 News Release \\nIn a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island site of a US military outpost His Majesty King Murjel Hermios through his legal representative Minister Plenipotentiary Robert Moore the US has been given the boot out of Wake Island Moore served legal notice on top US government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands The filing came on the heels of a fiveyear struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands owned by predecessors of King Hermios by the gun boat USS Bennington in 1899 \\nThe legal document a Commercial Affidavit Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes It details the specifics of King Hermios ancestral rights to Wake Island the illegality of the US claim and violations of native laws International Agreements and human rights during their 95year hold on the Hermios property It also establishes default recognized under law by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged Under those claims demand was made for payment of 947 million dollars for past use of the land Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995 \\nWhile putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights US officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile \\nEneenKio Atoll a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange kio flower found there is made up of 3 islands including Wake Predecessors in interest of King Hermios aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to EneenKio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand the islanders themselves A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians who recently gained an apology from the US Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal US government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief Iroijlaplap of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands which terminates to the north beyond EneenKio Atoll Mr Moore has full authority to act on the Kings behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the Kings assertion of his native allodial rights Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the US Air Force command 15th Logistics Group Hickam AFB Hawaii Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31 1993 and January 1 1994 headlined Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island and stated Not much activity there anymore so the Air Force wants to give up control According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios his predecessors and people Mr Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government to initiate and administer to its citizens promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council \\nSince 1987 despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke Mr Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States military officers and members of Congress The following is a summary of some of the recent letters inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner King Murjel Hermios ¬ª ¬ª Formal letters to President Clinton and VicePresident Al Gore in February 1993 requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored As a military base Wake Airfield was decommissioned more than a decade ago \\n¬ª ¬ª In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed \\nTheater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and US Army officials who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands went unanswered ¬ª ¬ª Letters to members of the US Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered ¬ª ¬ª A Resolution dated March 21 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios It was likewise ignored After waiting for more than 580 days since formal notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States Mr Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council They along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to EneenKio formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30 1994 They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio  While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of EneenKio Atoll which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan the Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth Honor and Peace Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States Those tenets were likewise embodied affirmed and ratified by the US Congress in Public Law 99239 Jan 14 1986 signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese natural rights including those of ownership and use of land \\nStill mindful of the

       " ['It was the Spring of 1979  \\n\\nI was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buckteeth and freckles  Each day in the\\ncafeteria I walked from table to table \\n\\nStealing other kids lunch money\\n\\nNo I didnt rob them with a gun or a knife  I just made\\nthem a little deal  Let me borrow two dollars today I said\\nand Ill bring you five dollars next week  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes  Of course \\nwhen next week rolled around and I couldnt pony up the cash\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went high school\\nstarted and with it came girls and homework and parties\\nand sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last years lunch money\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid\\nand I didnt even get beat up\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn\\n\\nFirst of all greed is your number one enemy Youre not\\ngoing to turn 2 into 5 in a week so cash out when\\nyoure ahead  Dont wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket\\n\\nSecond never trust an investment adviser of any kind\\nThey are looking out for their own money not yours\\n\\nThe professionals those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW  According to those guys the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market the more money youre going to make\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\nNEVER  \\n\\nIn a sense they are right  If you put 250000 in an index\\nfund right now youll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years  But heres the problem\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich\\n\\nHell no\\n\\nYou want the money NOW  so you can enjoy it Its hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when youre seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years what would you do with it  Where would\\nyou travel  What kind of car would you buy  \\n\\nThe fact is  youth is the best time to be rich\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility\\nis your ally and stability your enemy  You want to see\\nthose large upswings two hundred points in a day followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later  You dont\\ncare if the market went up or down 20 this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE  Thats how youre going to make the \\nmoney\\n\\nWhat Im talking about here is day trading  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K In the long term of 510 years \\nhe makes money \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5000 shares of XYZ for a\\n25000 profit in a 510 minute trade  He acts quickly taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours sometimes within minutes  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this  and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it  Its not rocket science and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started\\n\\nSociety would

few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which theyd charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies\\n\\n1 That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson\\n\\n2 That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade\\n\\nHere is what the

through\\nhard work knowledge and determination\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading I started \\npracticing the trading art itself and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training

a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk emails legally\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going\\n\\nMETHOD  1 BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\\n\\n\\nLets say that you decide to start small just to see\\nhow it goes and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5000 emails each Lets also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 02 210 of 1\\nresponse the response could be much better but lets\\njust say it is only 02 Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\\n5000 each\\n\\nContinuing with this example you send out only\\n5000 emails With a 02 response that is only\\n10 orders for report  1 Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5000 emails each for a total of\\n50000 Out of those 50000 emails only 02\\nresponded with orders Thats 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report  2\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5000 emails each for\\na total of 500000 emails The 02 response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report  3\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5000 emails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million emails sent out The 02\\nresponse is 10000 orders for Report  4\\n\\nThose 10000 people send out 5000 emails each\\nfor a total of 50000000 50 million emails\\nThe 02 response to that is 100000 orders for\\nReport  5\\n\\nTHATS 100000 ORDERS TIMES 5 EACH  50000000\\nhalf a million dollars\\n\\nYour total income in this example is 1 50\\n 2 500  35000  4 50000\\n 5 500000  Grand Total55555000\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL  PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY\\n\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5000 YOU MAILED TO Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100000\\nemails each or more\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting with thousands more coming\\nonline every day Believe me many people will do\\njust that and more\\n\\nMETHOD  2 BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method  1 and add METHOD  2 as you\\ngo along For every 5 you receive all you must\\ndo is email them the report they ordered Thats it\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the email they send out\\nwith your name and address on it will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report\\n\\nAVAILABLE REPORTS \\nThe reason for the cash is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow wrong It is simply about time\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved etc Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER  NAME ONLY\\nNotes Always send 5 cash US CURRENCY for\\neach report Checks NOT accepted Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper On one of those sheets of\\npaper write the NUMBER  the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW \\n\\n \\nREPORT  1 The Insiders Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\\n\\nOrder Report  1 from\\nRui Sousa Santos\\nPO Box 132\\nTaylors

by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you IF YOU WANT TO\\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN There is NO LIMIT\\nto the income you can

above One of the people you send this\\nto may send out 100000 or more emails and your\\nname will be on every one of them \\n\\nRemember though the more you send out the more\\npotential customers you will reach So my friend\\nI have given you the ideas information materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW \\n\\nMORE TESTIMONIALS\\nMy name is Mitchell My wife Jody and I live in\\nChicago I am an accountant with a major US\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving junk mail I made fun of the whole\\nthing spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved I knew it wouldnt work\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet I made\\nmerciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old\\nI told you so on her when the thing didnt work \\n\\nWell the laugh was on me Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total  14720000  all cash\\nI was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby\\n\\nMitchell Wolf MD Chicago Illinois\\n\\nNot being the gambling type it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan\\nBut conservative as I am I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldnt get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders\\nI made 31921000 in the first 12 weeks \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live There simply isnt a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big\\n\\nDan Sondstrom Alberta Canada\\n\\nI had received this program before I deleted it\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try\\nOf course I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy so I had to wait until I was emailed\\nagain by someone else 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again I did not delete this one\\nI made more than 490000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks\\n\\nSusan De Suza New York NY\\n\\nIt really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in My first month I made 20\\nin the 2nd month I made 56000 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was 36284000\\nLife is beautiful Thanx to internet\\n\\nFred Dellaca Westport New Zealand\\n\\n\\nORDER YOUR

one judge described Charles Bronson nowÔøΩs your chance Bronson \\n the serial hostage taker not the movie star  has written a health and\\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\\n muscle power \\n \\n Solitary Fitness  a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson 48\\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement  explains how he\\n has turned himself into a lean mean fitness machine while living 23 hours a\\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet on a diet of scrubs grub and at\\n virtually no cost \\n \\n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\\n fortune on gym memberships protein supplements or designer trainers and\\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\\n exercise industry \\n \\n I pick up a fitness mag I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it is the\\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson ItÔøΩs a joke and a big con and they call\\n me a criminal You canÔøΩt help feeling he has a point \\n \\n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars having\\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind which features drawings and poems\\n created by Bronson while in prison And he is not the first prisoner to\\n discover creative expression while residing at Her MajestyÔøΩs pleasure \\n \\n Jimmy Boyle the Scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents\\n when he was sent to Barlinnie PrisonÔøΩs famous special unit which aimed to\\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\\n express their emotions artistically Boyle was sentenced to life for the\\n murder of Babs Rooney in 1967 Once released he moved to Edinburgh where he\\n has become a respected artist His first novel Hero of the Underworld was\\n published in 1999 and his autobiography A Sense of Freedom was made into an\\n awardwinning film \\n \\n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\\n Glasgow and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\\n officers earning him an extra sevenyear sentence But after being\\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended he learned to sculpt and\\n developed an interest in art He later published Autobiography of a Murderer\\n a frank account of GlasgowÔøΩs criminal culture in the 1960s which received\\n critical praise \\n \\n And Lord Archer doesnÔøΩt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\\n that have made him millions while in jail He recently signed a threebook\\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported ÔøΩ10 million and is no doubt\\n scribbling away as we speak \\n \\n So why is it that men like Collins Bronson and Boyle who can be so\\n destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck\\n on the inside Steve Richards BronsonÔøΩs publisher has published many books\\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\\n pragmatic and profound \\n \\n He says Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\\n known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the\\n chance to focus on their creative skills \\n \\n It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\\n education if their early years have been hard It could be the first time\\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents \\n \\n However Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that He says\\n Once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine\\n the very essence of who they are \\n \\n They ask themselves am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence Or\\n am I a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something\\n good \\n \\n Bronson  who was born Michael Gordon Peterson but changed his name to that\\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films  has so far been remembered\\n mainly for things bad He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\\n robbery in 1974 and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison In 2000 he was\\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\\n two days during a jail siege \\n \\n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs he is\\n renowned for his strength He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\\n and does up to 3000  yes 3000  pressups a day As he puts it I can hit\\n a man 20 times in four seconds I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds \\n \\n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise Solitary\\n Fitness might be the book which will see BronsonÔøΩs face sitting on every\\n coffee table in the land He might be the man to give us the dream body which\\n so many socalled fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into Because\\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists \\n \\n All this crap about highprotein drinks pills diets itÔøΩs just a load of\\n bollocks and a multimillionpound racket he writes in what can only be\\n described as a refreshingly honest style We can all be fat lazy bastards\\n itÔøΩs our choice IÔøΩm sick of hearing and reading about excuses if you stuff\\n your face with shit you become shit thatÔøΩs logical to me \\n \\n As motivational mantras go that might be just the kick up the er backside\\n we all needed \\n \\n \\n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\\n be available in bookstores from October at ÔøΩ799\\n\\n\\n Yahoo Groups Sponsor \\n4 DVDs Free sp Join Now\\nhttpusclickyahoocompt6YBBNXiEAAmG3HAA7gSolBTM\\n\\n\\nTo unsubscribe

pesky port lockout The freight still isnt moving\\nfactories are running out of parts produce is rotting and\\nretailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing\\nday \\n\\nOn Monday Bush stepped in and appointed a threemember panel to \\nsee how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy We hope this \\nisnt a difficult question as the panels been given all of one \\nday to report back When Bush gets the report on Tuesday the\\nnext step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the\\n1947 TaftHartley Act That would send employees back to work\\nfor 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the\\ndisputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages\\n\\nInvoking TaftHartley requires a threat to national health or\\nsafety  not the economy But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao\\ncovered that base in a statement on Monday saying the work\\nstoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military we knew \\nIraq would be in here somewhere Union officials quickly\\nresponded that their members have been unloading military cargo\\nthroughout the 10day shutdown said the LA Times but an\\nanonymous Bush administration official said that only a portion \\nof what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore\\n\\nPolitically this has been a tricky one Using TaftHartley\\nwould annoy labor right before congressional elections On the\\nother hand Voter discontent with Bushs handling of the\\nincreasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in\\npolls and such concerns may have outweighed the political\\ndanger to the Republican administration said the San Francisco \\nChronicle Also Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll\\nreported twothirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the \\neconomy Though the administration promised an unbiased\\nexamination of the lockout Bush appeared to have made up his\\nmind that it was hurting national security and the economy\\nandmerited federal intervention said the AP \\n\\nAs for TaftHartley its not exactly famous for solving labor\\ndisputes Often the 80day coolingoff period ends and workers\\nsimply walk out again or get locked out again in this case\\nOne gets the sense however that fixing the dockworkers\\ncontract isnt the point of this particular 80 days Its 78\\ndays until Christmas The race is on  Jen Muehlbauer\\n\\nPresident Acts To

Justice\\nDepartment are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of\\nDirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95 of satellite \\nservice in the US\\n\\nThe press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed\\nmerger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics  \\nit was described as being worth anywhere from 15 billion and\\n25 billion It was a challenge to keep the players straight as \\nsome outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents\\nand others referred to the service monikers Hughes is DirecTV\\nand EchoStar is Dish All straight\\n\\nThe two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold\\noff ruling on read rejecting the merger until the Justice\\nDepartment has spoken EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified\\nmajor revisions to the deal that they want to discuss with\\nJustice in the next weeks\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those\\nrevisions could take  specifically selling some frequencies\\nto Cablevision The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted \\nto get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the \\ncable companys plans and past spending on such a project\\n\\nTheStreetcom turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for\\ninvestors in the satellite space It seems the market for\\nexpandedservice television may be nearing

may seem like all Iraq all the time in the Oval Office but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week that pesky port lockout The freight still isnt moving factories are running out of parts produce is rotting and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day PP\\nOn Monday Bush stepped in and appointed a threemember panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy We hope this isnt a difficult question as the panels been given all of one day to report back When Bush gets the report on Tuesday the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 TaftHartley Act That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax\\ndosagesPP\\nInvoking TaftHartley requires a threat to national health or safety  not the economy But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10day shutdown said the LA Times but an anonymous Bush administration official said that only a portion of\\nwhat the Defense Department needs has made it ashorePP\\nPolitically this has been a tricky one Using TaftHartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections On the other hand Voter discontent with Bushs handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration said the San Francisco Chronicle Also Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported twothirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the\\neconomy Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy andmerited federal intervention said the AP PP\\nAs for TaftHartley its not exactly famous for solving labor disputes Often the 80day coolingoff period ends and workers simply walk out again or get locked out again in this case One gets the sense however that fixing the dockworkers contract isnt the point of this particular 80 days Its 78 days until Christmas

birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry fowl We mean foul The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces the better to compete with Big Cable Federal regulators both the FCC and the Justice Department are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95 of satellite service in the USPP\\nThe press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics  it was described as being worth anywhere from 15 billion and 25 billion It was a challenge to keep the players straight as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents and others referred to the service monikers Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish All straightPP\\nThe two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on read rejecting the merger until the Justice Department has spoken EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified major revisions to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeksPP\\nThe Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take  specifically selling some frequencies to Cablevision The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable companys plans and past spending on such a projectPP\\nTheStreetcom turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space It seems the market for expandedservice television may be nearing saturation TheStreetcom quoted an analysts report which concluded Consumers should benefit from  continued rivalry but shareholders may realize much smaller returnsPP\\nThe New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings Last year

incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on\\nstatutory public holidays Head for the beach and maybe swing by BQ on the\\nway home I had hoped I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\\nsea an icecream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins\\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\\nfor once instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\\nmaybe me and you too\\nBut BQ and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamzas budget since the\\nBank of England froze his assets so Victoria Park had to do But he sounded\\nhappy enough when I spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful Islamic\\nprotowarriors in the background\\nYou must know Hamza hes the imam designed it would seem by the Daily\\nMails cartoonist Mac Large metal hook in place of a left hand One eye\\ncovered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milkywhite We dont\\nmock the disabled any more these days unless its someone like Hamza whom\\nwe dont like then if youll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come\\noff So Hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the\\nBritish right as Captain Hook in articles which usually call for his\\narrest or extradition to the US or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan where he fought the Russians for years and\\nthus sustained his disabilities  anywhere really just out of here And if\\nwe cant lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him\\nto shut up\\nBecause we dont like Hamza very much We werent that fond of him before\\nSeptember 11 but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all\\nthought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political\\npersecution\\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because theyve\\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\\nmanner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam All out of\\ncontext and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered But\\nperhaps he should be because our reputation for broadmindedness and\\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirrors\\nscoop\\nHamza preaches or preached at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque  so earlier\\nthis year the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\\nallegedly inflammatory remarks I didnt know Charity Commissioners were\\nmeant to do stuff like that\\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been\\nfrozen He is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the\\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\\nand the press And this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly\\n repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be\\ntrue  Hamza is not representative of British Muslims as if British\\nMuslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\\nturn to every now and then for explanation And perhaps succour\\nThe trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\\nrevealed to be rather more representative than the list of those\\ngovernmentapproved Muslim spokesmen who were  uncomfortably I suspect \\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban\\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4s Today programme revealed that an\\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bushs crusade\\nOne in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the US\\nthe remainder condemned the attack unequivocally A large majority thought\\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam\\nWhich is what Hamza said repeatedly But it was something that at the\\ntime we didnt want to hear Now if you quiz the man on present policy at\\nhome and abroad he comes across  superficially at least  as someone from\\nthe liberal left No war against Iraq Britain to become independent of US\\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states stronger action\\nagainst Israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth\\nNor is he particularly antisemitic so far as I can tell although I dont\\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year In yesterdays Guardian\\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\\nfor the sheikhs message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked\\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\\nbeen wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more\\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public His\\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam he would be\\nhappy in a truly Islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for\\nexample You and I would find many  perhaps most  of his views utterly\\nrepellent\\nAnd thats the point Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\\nto be multicultural Multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful\\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\\nruling hegemony That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism\\nMulticulturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that\\nare antithetical to the dominant culture  and maybe learn from them\\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza but of course has found nothing\\nremotely incriminating The real reason for his vilification and persecution\\nis simply the pungency of his views\\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally This\\nis a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash\\nYou dont defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesnt exist And\\nif British Muslims  maybe a minority maybe not  feel a growing sense of\\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is\\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza Shutting the man\\nup therefore wont make a difference\\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it\\nThe glass is falling hour by hour the glass will fall for ever\\nBut if you break the bloody glass you wont hold up the weather\\n\\n\\n Yahoo Groups Sponsor \\n4 DVDs Free sp

device\\nByÔøΩScott Tyler Shafer\\nAugust 27 2002 546 am PT\\n\\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software DataPowers device processes the data in \\nhardware  a technology achievement that provides greater performance \\naccording to company officials\\n\\nThe new device dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge Massbased startup The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the XML \\ndata\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly CEO of DataPower the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses\\n\\nOur vision is to build out an XMLaware infrastructure Kelly said \\nThe XA35 is the first of a family\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times This he said makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML\\n\\nTodays firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only Kelly \\nsaid A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity especially as Web services proliferate Kelly said\\n\\nAccording to DataPower most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software  an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security After trying the software path the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware\\n\\nOur XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code said Kelly \\nadding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing  claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false\\nOther contentaware switches such as SSL secure socket layer \\naccelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes of a packet \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at 1400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data Kelly explained\\n\\nThe 1Uhigh network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML Kelly said\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application \\ncoprocessor This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market Startup \\nSarvega based in Burr Ridge Ill introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay and earlier this month Tarari an Intel spinoff launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration\\nThe DataPower device is now available priced starting at 54995 The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises\\n\\n\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew Kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass MIT engineers and \\ndesigned the industrys first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML The first

\\n \\n DataPower delivers XML acceleration device\\n ByÔøΩScott Tyler Shafer\\n August 27 2002 546 am PT\\n \\n DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\n specifically to process XML data Unlike competing solutions that \\n process XML data in software DataPowers device processes \\n the data in \\n hardware  a technology achievement that provides greater \\n performance \\n according to company officials\\n \\n The new device dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator is the \\n first in a \\n family of products expected from the Cambridge Massbased \\n startup The \\n DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\n called XG3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the XML \\n data\\n \\n According to Steve Kelly CEO of DataPower the XA35 Accelerator was \\n conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML the anticipated future \\n proliferation of Web services and as a means to share data \\n between two \\n businesses\\n \\n Our vision is to build out an XMLaware infrastructure Kelly said \\n The XA35 is the first of a family\\n \\n Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \\n file size up \\n to 20 times This he said makes processing the data very taxing on \\n application servers DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\n alternative\\n \\n In addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount \\n importance in the world of XML\\n \\n Todays firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only Kelly \\n said A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall \\n Firewalls are blind to XML today\\n \\n Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\n security especially as Web services proliferate Kelly said\\n \\n According to DataPower most existing solutions to offload XML \\n processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach \\n the company \\n itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \\n regards to speed \\n and security After trying the software path the company turned to \\n creating a solution that would process XML in hardware\\n \\n Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code said Kelly \\n adding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does Kelly \\n said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\n technologies that claim to do XML processing  claims that \\n he believes \\n will be mostly false\\n Other contentaware switches such as SSL secure socket layer \\n accelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes \\n of a packet \\n while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at \\n 1400 bytes \\n and thus enabling greater processing of XML data Kelly explained\\n \\n The 1Uhigh network device has been tested against a large \\n collection of \\n XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \\n markup language \\n as they pass through the device\\n \\n The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\n balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \\n will identify \\n and process those packets that are XML Kelly said\\n \\n In addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an \\n application \\n coprocessor This deployment method gives administrators \\n more granular \\n control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\n controls the device\\n \\n DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging \\n market Startup \\n Sarvega based in Burr Ridge Ill introduced the Sarvega \\n XPE switch in \\n May and earlier this month Tarari an Intel spinoff \\n launched with a \\n focus on content processing and acceleration\\n The DataPower device is now available priced starting at \\n 54995 The \\n company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\n field trails at a number of other enterprises\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs \\n since it was \\n founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov a technology visionary who \\n foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\n would have on enterprise networks Long before industry \\n interest in XML \\n grew Kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass MIT engineers and \\n designed the industrys first solutions to address the unique \\n requirements for processing XML The first such solution was \\n a software \\n interpreter called DGXT This softwarebased approach to XML \\n processing \\n is still licensed by many companies for use in their own \\n products today\\n \\n Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\n developing softwarebased accelerators Kuznetsovs team \\n raised the bar \\n and designed a system for processing XML in purposebuilt \\n hardware In \\n 2001 DataPowers effort produced XML Generation Three XG3ÔøΩ the \\n industrys fastest technology for XML processing bar none\\n \\n Today XG3ÔøΩ technology

network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software DataPowers device processes the data in \\nhardware  a technology achievement that provides greater performance \\naccording to company officials\\n\\nThe new device dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator is the first in a\\n\\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge Massbased startup The\\n\\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the XML \\ndata\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly CEO of DataPower the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses\\n\\nOur vision is to build out an XMLaware infrastructure Kelly said \\nThe XA35 is the first of a family\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\\n\\nto 20 times This he said makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML\\n\\nTodays firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only Kelly \\nsaid A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity especially as Web services proliferate Kelly said\\n\\nAccording to DataPower most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software  an approach the company\\n\\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security After trying the software path the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware\\n\\nOur XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code said Kelly \\nadding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing  claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false\\nOther contentaware switches such as SSL secure socket layer \\naccelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes of a packet\\n\\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at 1400 bytes\\n\\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data Kelly explained\\n\\nThe 1Uhigh network device has been tested against a large collection of\\n\\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML Kelly said\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application\\n\\ncoprocessor This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market Startup \\nSarvega based in Burr Ridge Ill introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in\\n\\nMay and earlier this month Tarari an Intel spinoff launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration\\nThe DataPower device is now available priced starting at 54995 The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew Kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass MIT engineers and \\ndesigned the industrys first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT This softwarebased approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping softwarebased accelerators Kuznetsovs team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purposebuilt hardware In \\n2001 DataPowers effort produced XML Generation Three XG3ÔøΩ the \\nindustrys fastest technology for XML processing bar none\\n\\nToday XG3ÔøΩ technology powers the industrys first wirespeed XML \\nnetwork devices enabling secure highspeed applications and XML Web \\nServices While other companies are just now marketing first versions of\\n\\nproducts DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology \\nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \\nindustryleading customers and partners\\n\\nDataPowers MIT heritage is complemented by a management team that \\nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries\\n\\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\nAkamai Argon Cascade Castle Networks Sycamore and Wellfleet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDataPower Technology Secures 95 Million

remote village in Perus Andes could find no cure her father carried her to hospital \\n\\nJust over a month later she gave birth to a boy \\n\\nAged 5 years seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939 Medina made medical history and is still the youngest known mother in the world \\n\\nAt the time Perus government promised aid that never materialized Six decades on Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor crimeridden district of the Peruvian capital known as Little Chicago \\n\\nNow 68 she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past Gerardo the son she delivered while still a child herself died in 1979 at the age of 40 \\n\\nBut a new book written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case has drawn fresh attention to Medinas story and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance \\n\\nThe government condemned them to live in poverty In any other country they would be the objects of special care Jose Sandoval author of Mother Aged 5 told Reuters \\n\\nWe still have time to repair the damage done to her Thats my fundamental objective he added \\n\\nTotally willing to help\\nSandoval has raised Medinas case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp and has asked the government to grant her a life pension  something officials say is possible \\n\\nWere totally willing to help her said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda But Suni Ramos of the social action department of Karps office said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning  such as kitchen and other household equipment  it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family \\n\\nMedinas husband Raul Jurado told Reuters his wife remained skeptical She got no help in 1939 that I know about he said She thinks governments never deliver Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true \\n\\nJurado said his wife whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had turned down Reuters request for an interview \\n\\nMedical rarity\\nNo one has ever established who was the father of Medinas child or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped \\n\\nOne of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo an Andean village at an altitude of 7400 feet 2250 meters in Perus poorest province Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history Sandoval said \\n\\nHe said she had her first period at 2 12 became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby they found she already had fully mature sexual organs \\n\\nHer swelling stomach worried her parents They thought it was a tumor he said But shamans ruled out village superstitions  including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them  and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town Pisco \\n\\nThere came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant \\n\\nHer father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest  he was later released for lack of evidence  and doctors police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case \\n\\nSandoval who based his book on media and other published information and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment said news of the child mothertobe drew instant offers of aid including one worth 5000 from a US businessman which was turned down \\n\\nMore offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital where her fully developed 6pound 27 kg baby was born on May 14 1939  Mothers Day \\n\\nOne offer was worth 1000 a week plus expenses for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the Worlds Fair in New York Another from a US business that the family accepted in early June 1939 was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort \\n\\nBut within days the state trumped all previous offers decreeing that Medina and her baby were in moral danger and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them \\n\\nBut Sandoval said It abandoned the case after six months It did absolutely nothing for them \\n\\nHappy ending\\nThough physically mature Medina  who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms  still behaved like a child preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby who was fed by a wet nurse \\n\\nMedina stayed in hospital for 11 months finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again \\n\\nAfter taunting from schoolmates Gerardo  who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor  discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother \\n\\nHe died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the bodys bone marrow but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young \\n\\nMedina married and in 1972 had a second son 33 years after her first Her second child now lives in Mexico \\n\\nShe appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject We just want to get on with our lives thats it said Jurado adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the worlds youngest mother \\n\\nHe said the couples main concern now if the governments offer of aid was genuine was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the thengovernment expropriated more than two decades ago That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site \\n\\nHe said its value was more or less 25000 and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own  they live now in a modest house accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise \\n\\nIf the government really wants to helpthey should give us the value of our property he said \\n\\nAs for Sandoval he said he was optimistic that Medinas story which he has studied since his student days would turn out well I believe there will be a happy ending he said \\n\\nAs a result of the war corporations have now been enthroned and an era\\nof corruption in high places will follow and the moneypower of the\\ncountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\\nprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands\\nand the Republic is destroyed\\nAbraham Lincoln Nov 21 1864 in a letter to Col William

\\nhttpcanadajusticegcca and Industry Canada \\nhttpwwwicgcca wrote the 21page blueprint as a nearfinal step \\nin a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to \\nconduct electronic surveillance A proposed law based on the discussion \\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\nearly 2003\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form \\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\ncombat even runofthemill crimes They also claim that by enacting \\nthese proposals Canada will be following its obligations under the \\nCouncil of Europes cybercrime treaty \\nhttpnewscomcom21001001268894html which the country is in the \\nprocess of considering\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the \\npossession of computer viruses authorize police to order Internet \\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months and \\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden \\nelectronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing In \\nmost circumstances a court order would be required for

there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority \\nmake that case\\n\\nGeist added that theres nothing in the document that indicates new \\npowers are needed I dont know that there have been a significant \\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention \\norders The United States has a similar requirement called the \\nCommunications Assistance for

Soviet Empire and the liberation\\nof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism\\n\\nTragically a generation from now we may be bitter adversaries\\n\\nEurope has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that\\nHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed progressive\\ntransnationalism The key doctrines of this form of postcommunist\\nprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas Among these are the\\ndeconstruction of nationalism the promotion of postnationalist ideas of\\ncitizenship ie a global citizenry a redefinition of democracy and\\nthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the\\nUnited Nations\\n\\nThe European Union itself a multinational organization built through the\\npooling of sovereignty by European nations is postdemocratic While there\\nis a European Parliament the EUs power resides mainly in the unelected\\nEuropean Commission EC and its unelected President who face few limits\\nto their power Instead of a limited consensual form of government where\\nelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws the EU has an\\nappointed oligarchic executive along with a large attendant bureaucracy\\nwhose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense Moreover\\nthe EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of\\nthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired\\nby the EUs political elite Both the EC and the European Court of Justice\\nregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member\\ngovernments This is a step backward in Europes political development\\n\\nEuropean criticism of America is on the rise and the European list of\\ncomplaints about America is a long and growing one They dislike the fact\\nthat our republican system of government is not based on proportional\\nrepresentation They hate the fact that our citizens own guns They despise\\nthe fact that we execute murderers They resent the fact that our economy\\nis so large and that Americans consume so much They also resentand fear\\n the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere\\nin the world\\n\\nOn August 9 2002 Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UKs Independent\\nnewspaper in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be\\nrestrained perhaps by a European military invasion followed by a decade\\nor so of occupation Fortunately the article is satirical not because it\\nexaggerates the way European progressives view the US but rather because\\nthe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of\\nthe US literally fantastic\\n\\nAt least for now\\n\\nDespite the tongueincheek nature of this editorial however the fact\\nremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European\\nintellectual and political elite\\n\\nThe Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in\\ncheck the activities of sovereign states Because they have built such a\\nsystem in Europe they feel its valid for the rest of the world America\\nhowever is the biggest obstacle to such a system The Europeans cannot\\nunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national\\nsovereignty and limited consensual and constitutional government than it\\ndoes on compliance with international norms They view all departures\\nfrom such norms as aberrant Because the UN member states all have an equal\\nvote in prescribing international norms they assume that since the\\nprocess is ostensibly legitimate the results must be as well The trouble\\nwith this idea of course is that it gives the views of nondemocratic\\nauthoritarian states the same weight as those of free democratic\\nsocieties It sanctifies the process with no regard to the actual results\\n\\nThus they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals\\nto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the\\nliberty of our citizens and similar refusals from Iraq because its\\ndictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power Our repeated references\\nto the US Constitution and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to\\ncomply with international norms are incomprehensible to them They assume\\ntherefore that our refusal is based on arrogance rather than on a\\ncommitment to\\nconstitutional rights\\n\\nNone of this bodes well for the future of EuroAmerican friendship or\\ncooperation If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in\\nfavor of the new progressivism their criticism of the US will rise while\\ntheir tolerance of our differences will fall Obviously in such a\\npolitical atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably\\nincrease\\n\\nThat thought is frightening enough Even more frightening however is the\\nthought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the\\nnew ideology of

2002\\n\\nLast year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first \\nfairly serious Americanhistory course indignantly reported that the \\nwhole subject was incomprehensible I was shocked What about Gettysburg \\nand the Declaration of Independence and the SelmatoMontgomery march \\nJust look at my textbook he said and when I did I saw his point His \\nclass had got up to the eighteenforties What I expected was a big \\nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks and indeed \\nthere was some of that But the main difference between my sons text \\nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \\ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \\nhistory There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \\nreciprocal trade agreements I skipped ahead past the Civil War hoping \\nfor easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \\nof freight rates Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \\nbecome possible to see the federal governments main function as \\nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice \\ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \\ninterests\\n\\nEven now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \\nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington what youd find \\nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so \\nmuch over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real \\nestate banks versus insurance companies and so on The arena in which \\nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \\ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them Its \\nan insiders game less because the players are secretive than because \\nthe public and the pressÔøΩencouraged by the players who speak in jargonÔøΩ\\ncant get themselves interested\\n\\nOne corner of Washington might be called FCC World for the Federal \\nCommunications Commission FCC World has perhaps five thousand \\ndenizens They work at the commission itself at the House and Senate \\ncommerce committees and at the Washington offices of the companies that \\nthe commission regulates They read Communications Daily subscription \\nprice 3695 a year and every year around Christmastime they \\ngrumblingly attend the Chairmans Dinner at a Washington hotel where \\nthe high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly selfdeprecating \\ncomedy routine by the commissions chairman\\n\\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions the FCC is the one that \\nAmericans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with \\na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \\nAmerican economy as well as important aspects of daily lifeÔøΩtelephone \\nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet And right now \\nFCC World is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather \\nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \\ncorporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies \\nregulated by the FCC Qwest WorldCom Adelphia and Global Crossing \\namong others are or were part of FCC World AOL Time Warner is \\npart of FCC World Jack Grubman the former Salomon Smith Barney \\nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay of Enron as the \\nembodiment of the corporate scandals is part of FCC World In the \\npast two years companies belonging to FCC World have lost trillions \\nof dollars in stockmarket valuation and have collectively served as a \\ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market\\n\\nThis year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \\nof the FCC has been circulating widely within FCC World It evokes \\nFCC Worlds feverish mood The FCC is fiddling while Rome burns \\nand suggests why nobody besides residents of FCC World has thought of \\nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals The sentence I \\njust quoted is followed by this explanation The ILECs appear likely to \\nenter all ld markets within twelve months while losing virtually no \\nresidential customers to attackers since 1996 and suffering about 10 \\nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs Its a lot easier to \\nthink about evil CEOs than to decipher that\\n\\n\\nEven in good times FCC World pays obsessive attention to the \\ncommissions chairman In bad times the attention becomes especially \\nintense and when the chairman is a celebrity FCC World devotes \\nitself to fulltime chairmanwatching The current chairman Michael \\nPowell is a celebrity at least by governmentofficial standards \\nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell the Secretary of State \\nUnlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which \\ngenerates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about \\nwho he really is and what hes really up to Powell is young to be the \\nhead of a federal agencyÔøΩhe is thirtynineÔøΩand genially charming \\nEverybody likes him Before becoming chairman he was for three years \\none of the FCCs five commissioners not only is he fluent in the \\nFCCs incomprehensible patois he has a Clintonesque love of the \\narcane details of communications policy Hes always saying that hes an \\navid moderate And yet he has a rageinciting quality One of his \\npredecessors as chairman Reed Hundt quoted in Forbes compared Powell \\nto Herbert Hoover Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America \\ncalls him radical and extreme Just as often as hes accused of being \\na rightwing ideologue Powell gets accused of being paralytically \\ncautious It aint about singing KumBaYah around the campfire \\nanother former chairman William Kennard says You have to have an \\nanswer One day last spring Powell testifying before a Senate \\nsubcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the \\nsubcommittees chairman Ernest Hollings of South Carolina berated \\nhim You dont care about these regulations Hollings said You dont \\ncare about the law or what Congress sets down    Thats the \\nfundamental Thats the misgiving I have of your administration over \\nthere It just is amazing to me You just pellmell down the road and \\nseem to not care at all I think youd be a wonderful executive \\nvicepresident of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a \\nregulatory commission at the government level Are you happy in your \\njob\\n\\nExtremely Powell said with an amiable smile\\n\\n\\nOne cannot understand Powells maddening effect at least on Democrats \\nand liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose \\nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose The FCC was \\ncreated by Congress in 1934 but it existed in prototype well before the \\nNew Deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \\ncases for government intervention in the private economy making sure \\nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves Its \\nother original function was preventing American Telephone  Telegraph \\nthe national monopoly phone company from treating its customers \\nunfairly Over the decades as FCC World grew up into a comfortable \\nwellestablished place the FCC segued into the role of industrial \\nsupervisionÔøΩits real purpose It was supposed to manage the competition \\namong communications companies so that it didnt become too bloody by \\nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business \\nIn addition to looking out for the publics interest the commission \\nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress many \\nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \\nterrifying category of interest groupÔøΩyou can cross the local bank \\npresident and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster \\nAccording to an ofttold FCC World anecdote President Clinton once \\nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \\nin the same city because he said if the soandso who owned the \\nantiClinton Little Rock DemocratGazette had owned the leading TV \\nstation in Little Rock too Clinton would never have become President\\n\\n\\nFCC World may have been con tentious but it was settled too \\nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \\nniches for themselves Then in the nineteeneighties the successful \\nbreakup of AT  TÔøΩby far the biggest and most important company the \\ncommission regulatedÔøΩdeposited a thick additional sediment of \\nselfconfidence onto the consciousness of FCC World A generation \\nago for most Americans there was one local phone company one \\nlongdistance company and one company that manufactured telephones \\nwhich customers were not permitted to ownÔøΩand they were all the same \\ncompany It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line By the \\nmidnineteennineties there were a dozen economically viable local \\nphone companies a handful of national longdistance companies competing \\nto offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores \\neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersÔøΩand \\nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \\ntelephone lines AT  T had argued for years that it was a natural \\nmonopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total \\ncontrol over its lines So much for that argument Over the same period \\nthe FCC had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \\nand the Internet It was the dream of federalagency success come true \\nconsumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more \\nprosperous too\\n\\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \\none of those massive endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which \\nmost people outside FCC World probably felt it was safe to ignore \\nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \\nmodernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interestgroup \\nbargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers \\nas baby Bells and to FCC World as arbocks the pronounced version \\nof RBOCs or regional Bell operating companies would be permitted to \\noffer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance \\ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \\ncustomers Consumers would win because for the first time they would \\nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \\ncompetition than they already had in long distance But the politics and \\neconomics of the Telecom Act which was shepherded through Congress by \\nVicePresident Gore were just as important Democrats saw the act as \\nhelping to reposition them as the technology partyÔøΩthe party that \\nbrought the Internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of \\njobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose \\nbeneficiaries might become the partys new contributor base Clintons \\nslogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to \\nthe twentyfirst century which like all Clinton slogans artfully \\nsent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical \\ncorrelates of the Telecom Act and Gores cruise to the Presidency was \\nsupposed to be powered substantially by the acts success\\n\\nThe FCC had a crucial role in all this The arbocks are rich \\naggressive politically powerful and generally Republican though like \\nall important interest groups they work with both parties they \\nimmediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new \\ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years Through \\nrulemaking enforcement and litigation the FCC then headed by \\nReed Hundt who was Gores classmate at St Albans was supposed to keep \\nthe arbocks in their cages so that not only longdistance companies \\nlike AT  T and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \\ncompanies seelecks the pronounced version of CLECs or competitive \\nlocal exchange carriers could emerge This entailed the regulatory \\nequivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have \\naccess to the arbocks switching equipment the arbock wont give the \\nseeleck a key to the room where its kept so the seeleck asks the \\nFCC to rule that the arbock has to give it the key\\n\\nPartly because Hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that \\nhe would protect them and partly because of the generally booming \\ncondition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the \\nseelecksÔøΩcompanies with names like Winstar Covad and TeligentÔøΩand \\ninto other telecommunications companies Even not obviously related \\ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \\nboom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks \\nand other new players There would be no conflict between the interests \\nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of Hundts \\nformer lieutenants told me Reed used to joke that my job was to make \\nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up\\n\\n\\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \\nboom Wall Street had its blood up and that meant not just more \\nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies \\nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together and AT  T and \\nComcast and so on Surely WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \\nbelieved that their selfdealing stockoverselling and creative \\naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \\nundiscriminating\\n\\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \\ndetermined the telecom crash was well under way Nonetheless the \\nchairmanship of the FCC remained one of the best jobs in terms of \\ninfluence and visibility available to a career government regulator \\nThree Republicans emerged as candidates Powell who was a commissioner \\nHarold FurchtgottRoth the farthesttotheright commissioner and \\nPatrick Wood the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and as \\nsuch a George W Bush guy In Texas however Wood had crossed the most \\npowerful person in the arbock camp Edward Whitacre the CEO of \\nSBC Communications which is headquartered in San Antonio This meant \\nthat the arbocks didnt want Wood as head of the FCC because he \\nmight be too proseeleck Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \\nRegulatory Commission Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \\nwasnt as threatening as Wood while also signalling the conservative \\nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \\nFurchtgottRoth\\n\\nPowell did this deftly For example in December of 2000 he appeared \\nbefore a conservative group called the Progress  Freedom Foundation and \\ngave a very Michael Powell speechÔøΩwhimsical intellectual and \\nfreeassociative Biblical history Joseph Schumpeter Moores LawÔøΩthat \\nbegan by making fun of the idea that the FCC should try to keep new \\ntelecom companies alive In the wake of the 1996 Act the FCC is \\noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas Powell said Like the \\nWhos down in Whoville who feast on Whopudding and rare Whoroast \\nbeast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \\nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Acts \\nfertile soil But this feast the FCC Grinch did not like in the \\nleast so it is thought Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \\nchairman he didnt expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as \\npart of the job He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \\nof the Bush Administration\\n\\nTwenty months into the Administration nearly all the seelecks are dead \\nor dying nearly all longdistance companies not just WorldCom are in \\nserious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite \\ncompanies are staggering The crash has had an automatically \\nconcentrating effect because as new companies die the existing \\ncompanies market share increases and if the existing companies are in \\ngood shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \\ncompanies at bargain prices During the Bush Administration as the \\nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened the communications \\nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration If the Bells \\nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and \\nif they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national \\nduopoly in local service Verizon in the East and SBC in the West \\nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the \\npoor health of the longdistance companies\\n\\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \\ncompanies AOL Time Warner and Comcast Unlike the phone companies they \\ndont have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \\nfully control what material they allow to enter peoples homes As part \\nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \\nTelecom Act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \\nsignificantly loosened and in the past six years the number of \\nradiostation owners in the United States has been cut by twentyfive \\nper cent today a large portion of local and national radio news \\nprogramming is supplied by a single company Westwood One a subsidiary \\nof Viacom\\n\\nIn this situation many Democrats and liberals think the FCC should \\nbe hyperactiveÔøΩthe superhero of government regulation springing to the \\nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry It should try \\nto breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies It should \\ndisallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the \\nforces of concentration It should use the governments money and muscle \\nto get new technologyÔøΩespecially fast Internet connectionsÔøΩinto the \\nhomes of people who cant afford it at current market prices An \\nanalogy that a lot of people in FCC World make is between telecom and \\nthe Middle East the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \\npeople because they disengaged when they came into office and the Bush \\npeople blame it on the Clinton people because they raised too many \\nexpectations and stirred too many passions\\n\\nBut Michael Powells FCC has not been hyperactive Powell has been \\nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \\nFCC and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \\nsignals In midSeptember Powell finally initiated a formal review of \\nthe FCCs limits on media concentration This doesnt mean he has \\nbeen inactive rather he has been active in a way that further \\ninfuriates his criticsÔøΩin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \\nthe provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \\nFCC World really make sense while giving the impression that hes \\nhaving the time of his life as chairman At his first press conference \\nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the digital \\ndivideÔøΩthat is economic inequality in access to the InternetÔøΩhe said \\nYou know I think there is a Mercedes divide Id like to have one and \\nI cant afford one At the National Cable  Telecommunications \\nAssociation convention in Chicago Powell following a troupe of \\ntumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \\nsomersault\\n\\n\\nNot long ago I went to see Powell in his office at the FCC Until \\n1998 when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \\nWashington near the citys openair fish market FCC World was at \\nthe western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody \\nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars Today the FCC building \\nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park \\nEven the chairmans suite though large is beige carpeted and \\nfluorescent Powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and \\nwalks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a \\njeep accident in Germany in 1987 when he was an Army officer Because \\nof the accident he left the Army and went to law school where he \\nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly \\nthe idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of \\nthe market before the factÔøΩprophylactically as he likes to sayÔøΩshould \\nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \\nlitigation to fix them He worked briefly at a corporate law firm and \\nthen became a protÔøΩgÔøΩ of Joel Klein the head of the antitrust division \\nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the governments \\nlegal case against Microsoft He was recently appointed chancellor of \\nthe New York publicschool system It testifies to Powells political \\nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \\nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \\nalso maintains close ties to Bushs nemesis Senator John McCain of \\nArizona One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \\nenduring love of law schoolÔøΩIts sort of like a lawschool study \\nsession over there one Democratic former commissioner said As if to \\nconfirm the charge Powell when I arrived introduced me to four law \\nstudents summer interns at the commission whom hed invited to sit in\\n\\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \\nof the FCC For example could private companies have apportioned the \\nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved\\n\\nI think well never know Powell said I dont think its an \\nautomatically bad idea the way some people will argue Land is probably \\nthe best analogue We dont seize all the land in the United States and \\nsay The government will issue licenses to use land If my neighbor \\nputs a fence one foot onto my property line theres a whole body of law \\nabout what I can do about that including whether I can tear it down If \\na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company its a \\nsimilar proposition There are scholars who argueÔøΩindeed the famous \\nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about thisÔøΩthat \\nspectrum policy is lunacy The market could work this out in the kinds \\nof ways that were accustomed to\\n\\nTalking to Powell was fun Unlike most high government officials he \\ndoesnt seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding He \\nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs He speaks in \\nironic air quotes Hes like your libertarian friend in college who \\nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \\nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \\nsees as sentimental or illogical After a while I asked him whether he \\nthought his predecessors excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \\nAct had been excessive\\n\\nI would start with a caveat Powell said Look I cant fault those \\njudgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought \\nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities \\nBut frankly Ive always been a little bit critical First of all \\nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesnt come anywhere close \\nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the President \\non down about the kinds of things its going to open up I mean I \\ndont know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions \\nor what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that \\nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction When one starts \\nreading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions \\nBut nonetheless there was a rising dotcom excitement and an Internet \\nexcitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it \\ncertainly was\\n\\nBut We were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of \\nexpectations that were being bandied around and this is before the \\neconomy or the market even gets in trouble It was a dramatically \\nexaggerated expectationÔøΩby the leadership of the commission by \\npoliticians by the market itself by companies themselves It was a \\ngold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones \\nthat government encouraged by its policies frankly Everybody wanted to \\nsee numbers go up on the board\\n\\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act  \\nI want to see ten competitors Twenty competitors I want to see \\nthirtypercent market share Fiftypercent market share I want the \\nBells to bleed Then well know weve succeeded  Now Powell returned \\nto being Powell I think that expectation was astonishingly \\nunrealistic in the short term They wanted to see it while theyre \\nthere We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking And \\nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking Theres no \\nquestion we went too soon too fast Too many companies took on too much \\ndebt too fast before the market really had a product or a business \\nmodel\\n\\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better We could have \\nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were \\nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system \\nPowell said Money chased what seemed like governmentpromised \\nopportunity The problem with that is theres a morning after and were \\nin it And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem This \\ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level In some \\nways for shortterm gain we paid a price in longterm stability\\n\\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \\nhad been a more reasonable level of investment No we wouldnt have \\nevery home in America with competitive choice yetÔøΩbut we dont anyway I \\ndont think its the remonopolization of telephone service I dont buy \\nthat The Bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldnt The \\npart of the story that didnt materialize was that people thought so \\nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint\\n\\nOther local phone companies he added hadnt materialized as viable \\nbusinesses either and they never might Everybodys always saying \\nThe regulators did this and this and this But candidly the storys \\nquite the opposite I think the regulators bent over backward for six \\nyears to give them a chance Conditions dont get that good except once \\nevery thirty years and it didnt happen So whatever the reason were \\nlooking at a WorldCom thats teetering Were looking at a longdistance \\nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base AT  T is \\nbreaking itself up Sprint has struggled\\n\\nCould the FCC have done anything to make the longdistance companies \\nstronger At the FCC I think Ill just be blunt My political \\nanswer Yes theres all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \\nto help But I cant find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere \\nI cant mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an SEC \\ninvestigation Were I king it would be wonderful but I dont have \\nthose kinds of levers I dont know whether anybody does At some point \\ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \\ndying Powell couldnt have made it much clearer that he doesnt think \\nits his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash He has \\ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \\ngesturesÔøΩin August for example five months after disbanding the \\nFCCs Accounting Safeguards Division Powell announced that he was \\nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \\ncommunications industry But that shows that Powell is better at riding \\nout the storm than say Harvey Pitt his counterpart at the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \\nup the telecom industry\\n\\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if for most people only one \\ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \\nservice Yes he said It concerns us that theres one of each of \\nthose things but lets not diminish the importance of there being one \\nof each of those things That still is a nice suite of communications \\ncapabilities even if they arent direct analogues of each other \\nAnyway Powell said before long the phone companies will be able to \\nprovide video service over their lines and the cable companies will \\nprovide data service over their lines so there will be more choice \\nSo yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything The question \\nis Does it stay that way\\n\\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \\ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell either He said that \\npeople confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration \\nwhich distorts markets If this were just economics its easy If you \\nwere to say to me Mike just worry about economic concentration we \\nknow how to do thatÔøΩthe econometrics of antitrust I can tell you when a \\nmarkets too concentrated and prices are going to rise The problem is \\nother dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional Take \\nthe question of if everybodys controlling what you see the assumption \\nthere is that somehow therell be this viewpoint a monolithic \\nviewpoint pushed on you by your media and you wont get diversity I \\nthink thats a possibility I dont think its nearly the possibility \\nthats ascribed to it sometimes\\n\\nPowell explained Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \\nparochial programming it gets attacked as unfair I see some of the \\nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \\nexists They love diversity but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \\nthe planet If it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias \\nand then we have policies likeÔøΩhere his tone went from ironic to \\nsarcasticÔøΩthe fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis \\nof what I thought those people cared about So when somebody is pointed \\nand opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \\nfairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out\\n\\n\\nFCC World abounds in theories about Michael Powell One is that he \\ncant make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \\nhe regulatesÔøΩso he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the \\nmarket in order to buy himself time Another is that hes carrying \\nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies Another is that he is \\nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia or to be appointed \\nAttorney General in a second Bush term and doesnt want to do anything \\nat the FCC that would diminish his chances Another is that hes \\nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action \\nso that he doesnt wind up going first and getting caught in the \\ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \\nnetworks In FCC World this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \\nTelecom after Colin Powells idea that the United States should never \\ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force \\nand an exit strategy And another is that he actually believes what he \\nsays and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and \\nirreversible and more concentration would be just fine\\n\\nThis is why elections matter Reed Hundt who isnt happy about what \\nhas become of his Telecom Act told me Its true that the FCCÔøΩmuch \\nmore than say the war in AfghanistanÔøΩis a case in which a Gore \\nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \\nAdministration Consumers might have noticed the difference by now but \\ntheres no question whether communications companies have noticed The \\narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \\nhave done if Gore had won Next election theyll help the party that \\nhelped them If the Republicans win policy will tilt further in the \\narbocks favor If they lose perhaps the arbocks rivalsÔøΩthe \\nlongdistance companies and the telecommunications upstartsÔøΩwith their \\nfriends now in power will stage a comeback Americas present is not \\nunrecognizably different from Americas past\\n\\n\\n',\n",

corrections\\nappreciated\\n\\nStuff in s is my and others additions \\nto the debate\\n\\nMy apologies if Ive paraphrased anybody \\nincorrectly I will be glad to retract if \\nanyone is miffed\\n\\n\\n\\nThe article makes four main points\\n\\n\\n1 Absence of critical clauses \\n\\n\\nIn this case the idea is that the licence \\nis invalid because it doesnt specify\\nunder what countrys law the GPL is governed\\n\\n\\n2 Specification in English only\\n\\nThat for the end user as opposed to businesses \\nthe GPL doesnt apply because its not written \\nin French\\n\\n\\n3 Arbitary licence change\\n\\nThe point here is that under French law the \\nauthor can change the terms of the licence \\narbitarily This is because any granting of \\nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\\nin terms of how long where to whom dates and \\ntimes In the absence of such limitations the \\noriginal author has the right to change his \\nsoftware back to closed on a whim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \\nholder automatically retains the right to change \\nthe licence\\n\\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \\nall copyright holders\\n\\nThats not my understanding French law allows a \\nGPL type licence on condition that the \\nspecific conditions of the granting of such\\nrights are clear  if they are not there is\\nnothing to stop the original author taking\\nback his work The lawyers see this\\ncorrectly IMHO as a weakness in the GPL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Hidden defects\\n\\nRoughly this clause means that the authors \\nisare liable for any defects if the consumer \\nis not an IT engineer so if Linux blows up \\nand data is lost then the authors are liable\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCiaran Johnson says that Moft and others have \\nsimilar clauses  the point here is that they \\nare all invalid  just that this one \\naffects the GPL also\\n\\nNiall OBroinn makes the point that it is not\\na sale but rather a serviceleasing arrangement\\nand thats why it doesnt come under this point\\n\\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\\narticle has been to see software sales even\\nif no money changes hands as governed very\\nmuch by consumer law in France anyway\\n\\n\\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\\nare not default \\n\\nSee the bit about even the granting of \\nrights by an author having to be \\nexplicitly specified  under French law\\n\\n\\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \\nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 Roughly\\n\\nThere may be other reasons under French \\nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid\\n\\n\\n\\n  Whole Article \\n\\n\\nFreedoma is worth more than these \\nimperfect licences\\n\\n\\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL\\n\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky duly appointed to \\nthe court and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum both \\nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \\nexamine the free licences and in particular the \\nGPL They have published their study\\nin the review Proprietes intellectuelles \\nIntellectual property1 and their\\nconclusion is grim\\n\\n\\nTheir approach is interesting The problem for \\nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \\nFrench law for them the question is a moot point\\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \\nand the content of the text of free licences and \\nin particular the GPL The problem is not free \\nprogrammes but rather the licence contracts of \\nfree programmes\\n\\n\\n\\nAbsence of critical clauses\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authors tell us that first of all the \\nreference to copyright is not legally \\nsufficient in the framework of international \\ncontracts  which is the case of licence \\ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \\nvia the Internet The idea of copyright can \\nbasically include differences from one country \\nto another This is why under international \\ncontracts it is necessary to specify to which \\nlaws one is referring French law American c\\n\\nThe authors only found three public licences \\nwhich were correctly formulated on this point \\nQPL IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\\nLicence\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecification in the English language\\n\\n\\n\\nNext the authors remind us that at least in \\nFrance no clause in a contract may be contrary \\nto French law 2 However it turns out that a \\nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \\nin several respects Firstly it is written in \\nEnglish and the FSF doesnt officially approve \\ntranslations \\n\\nThe Toubon law obliges this sort \\nof contract to be written in French including for \\nbusinesses since the notion of user applies not \\nonly to consumers but also to businesses \\nprofessionals c \\n\\n\\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench \\nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that as \\nfar as business is concerned the Toubon \\nlaw is probably doomed to change since \\nit is in contradiction of European directives \\non the subject but whatever about that the \\nproblem is still valid for individuals and \\nwhile waiting for it French law to change \\nFrench companies have to deal with it since \\nit is the law of the land\\n\\n\\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \\nchange licence\\n\\n\\nAnother problem much more serious is \\nthat according to French law the author of \\na free programme can at any time invoke \\nthe invalidity of the licence for this \\nsoftware by simply changing the licence\\n\\n\\nIn effect the law of intellectual \\nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \\nrights by the author is subordinate to \\nthe condition that each of these granted \\nrights be the object of a distinct clause \\nin the granting act ie the licence and \\nthat the granting of any such rights be \\ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \\ngrantees and also with respect to its \\nlocation ie where such rights may be \\nexcersised  and duration of any such grants \\n3 This is not the case of the GPL nor of\\nother free licences Briefly this means \\nthat in France or elsewhere if the author \\nis French that which is under the GPL could \\nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next \\n \\n\\n\\nThe problem of the guarantee hidden defects\\n\\n\\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \\nguarantee The GPL licences and others show \\nthat the software is delivered without \\nguarantee You are going to immediately\\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \\nsame clause in their licence contracts\\nand this is correct However whatever is \\nwritten in a licence contract one cannot\\nfree oneself from the guarantee from \\nhidden defects since it is imposed in the \\nCivil Code This concept is poorly understood \\nby the layman it protects the buyer\\nwhoever it may be individual or business \\nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \\nconsumer protection law against hidden \\ndefects deliberate or made in good faith by \\nthe seller \\n\\n\\nFor example if one buys a pair of socks \\nin a sale and the shop has a notice \\nspecifying that Sale items are neither \\nrefunded nor exchanged and on arriving \\nhome you notice that one of the socks has \\na hole in it several scenarios are possible\\n\\n\\nYou could have checked the socks before \\npurchase the flaw is deemed obvious and\\nyou can sing for your money\\n\\n\\nYou couldnt check the socks they were \\npackaged for example and in this case \\ndespite the notice neither refund nor \\nexchange you may invoke hidden defect \\nand have them changed or obtain a refund \\nits up to you \\n\\nPersonally I have already invoked in shops \\nthe hidden defect clause and it always \\nworked well shopkeepers are always very \\ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \\nof the Civil Code \\n\\n\\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \\nwide it is necessary that you hadnt \\nthe possibility of discovering the defect \\nbefore buying the product and then \\naccording to the Civil Code that you \\nwouldnt have bought it at that price if \\nyou had known about the\\ndefect\\n\\n\\nThe third case which is much rarer  is \\nif you are able to show that the vendor had\\nknowledge of the defect hidden but didnt \\ninform you In this case not only does he \\nhave to reimburse the product but all \\nexpenses incurred by the sale metro \\ntickets to go to the shop the fuse \\nwhich blew when you plugged it in c\\n\\n\\nThis idea of hidden defect applies to\\n all products including programmes This \\nwas made abundantly clear by the \\nauthorities and the courts surrounding \\nY2K \\n\\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \\nfree programmes since a site which \\noffers a Linux distro for download is \\nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \\nhidden flaws\\n\\n\\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \\nin the case of a free programme \\none could speak about a hidden defect \\nsince the source code was available \\nhe replied Actually concerning the \\nguarantee the question of obvious \\ndefect will arise This analyis will \\nbe different depending on whether the \\nperson who downloads the distribution \\nis an IT professional or not \\n\\nOpenSource has this advantage over \\nthe proprietary programme it protects \\nthe distributor against a guarantee of\\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \\nIT person But for distribution to the \\npublic at large the problem remains \\nthe same\\n\\n\\n\\nRoughly Speaking\\n\\n\\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself \\nthis study is far from being exhaustive \\nand many other areas could be explored \\n\\nDuring this interview we asked ourselves \\nfor example about the fragility of the \\nGPL clause which forbids linking source \\ncode under the GPL with proprietary code \\n\\nIn effect the laws of intellectual \\nproperty give the right to the user \\nto modify a programme with the\\nintention of permitting interoperability \\nwith another programme If for that\\nI need to link with a proprietary library \\ncommunication protocol device driver\\nI may consider as null and void this \\nclause of the GPL\\n\\n\\nThe conclusion of this study is a wake \\nup call for the community Freedom \\nmerits more than these shoddy licences \\nwhich should be modified before court \\ncases over them proliferate and put at \\nrisk the undeniable originality of \\nthis effort\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Une publication de lInstitut \\nde

promising new companies not just turnarounds Its just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their 72B portfolio so far\\n\\nRohit\\n\\nkharealumnicaltechedu\\n\\n\\nTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend\\n\\nAugust 25 2002\\nBy RIVA D ATLAS and EDWARD WONG \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIt was one of the first calls David N Siegel placed when\\nhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways\\nlast March Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner\\nand meaner business plan keep his planes flying and\\nrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions he flipped\\nthrough his files and found the number for the Texas\\nPacific Group an investment firm headed by David\\nBonderman a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation\\nfor fixing problem companies \\n\\nMr Siegel once a top executive at Continental Airlines\\nhad watched Texas Pacifics partners turn an investment of\\n66 million in the airline made three years after it filed\\nfor bankruptcy in 1990 into a profit of more than 600\\nmillion And they had made nearly as much on their stake in\\nAmerica West which filed for bankruptcy in 1992 \\n\\nThat search for advice turned into an offer Why not let\\nTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways revival asked\\nRichard Schifter the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr\\nSiegel reached \\n\\nIn June Mr Siegel called Mr Schifter again And days\\nbefore US Airways announced its plans to file for\\nbankruptcy two weeks ago  but after it had negotiated\\nabout 550 million in concessions with its unions  Texas\\nPacific based in Fort Worth and San Francisco agreed to\\nkick in 100 million as part of a 500 million loan to keep\\nthe company operating during bankruptcy It also agreed to\\nbuy 200 million of stock or 38 percent of the company\\nand take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\\nfrom bankruptcy  unless another investor surfaces with a\\nbetter offer \\n\\nOne of the reasons we were interested is few other folks\\nwere said James Coulter a partner at Texas Pacific in\\nan interview after the bankruptcy filing There arent\\nmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge to\\ndelve into the airline industry \\n\\nTexas Pacific which manages 8 billion thrives by buying\\nbusinesses no one else wants Mr Coulter and Mr Bonderman\\nmade their names during the recession of the early 1990s\\nwith investments in Continental and America West The\\nfirms hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping\\ncompanies sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its\\nextensive network of contacts for talented replacements \\n\\nNow the partners are again looking for trouble In the last\\nyear alone Texas Pacific has announced or completed six\\nacquisitions most in unloved industries like\\nsemiconductors reinsurance and airlines Just last month\\nit announced plans to buy Burger King which has been\\nlosing market share for 226 billion It is also bidding\\nfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin a large and troubled bank \\n\\nThe most creative and potentially lucrative of these\\ndeals could be Texas Pacifics acquisition last November of\\nMEMC Electronic Materials a semiconductor company for 6\\n yes just 6  in cash It will also guarantee a 150\\nmillion bank loan \\n\\nIn the last few years most firms that specialize in\\nleveraged buyouts  the use of junk bonds bank loans and\\nother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies \\nhave been largely inactive Falling stock prices have made\\nmanagements reluctant to sell cheaply Companies that are\\nfor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze \\n\\nTexas Pacific is different This is a terrific environment\\nfor them said Stephen Schwarzman chief executive of the\\nBlackstone Group which also specializes in buyouts \\n\\nMark Attanasio a managing director at Trust Company of the\\nWest which has invested with Texas Pacific said Most\\nother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing\\nYou dont see many guys wanting to take on operational\\nfixes \\n\\nLike most other buyout firms Texas Pacific tries to keep\\nits inner workings private its partners rarely grant\\ninterviews and its Web site is perpetually under\\nconstruction Mr Bonderman Mr Coulter and William Price\\nthe third founding partner declined to be interviewed for\\nthis article \\n\\nMr Bonderman 59 is known for his rumpled shirts and\\nbright patterned socks He likes argyle socks and they\\ntend to fall down around his ankles said Henry Miller an\\ninvestment banker who advises troubled companies Early in\\nhis career when he was a Washington lawyer Mr Bonderman\\nargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit \\n\\nWhen a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated he is known\\nfor obsessively staying in touch even when he is trekking\\nin places like Pakistan Nepal and most recently Bhutan\\nWhenever I see a long unfamiliar phone number pop up on\\nmy caller ID I know its David calling said one\\ninvestment banker who often works with Mr Bonderman \\n\\nMr Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980s as the\\nchief investment officer for Robert Bass the Texas oilman\\nMr Bonderman enriched Mr Bass a second time by making\\nearly bets in industries like cable television and taking\\nstakes in troubled companies like American Savings  Loan\\nwhich had been seized by the government Over nearly a\\ndecade Mr Bondermans picks earned an average annual\\nreturn of 63 percent for Mr Bass \\n\\nIn 1993 Mr Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr\\nCoulter a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also\\nworked for Mr Bass They teamed up later that year with\\nMr Price a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain \\nCompany a consulting firm to form Texas Pacific \\n\\nThe three men have complementary skills investment bankers\\nand other deal makers said Mr Bonderman is the master\\nstrategist and Mr Coulter is good at structuring deals and\\nthe detailed management of the firms purchases Mr Price\\noften recruits managers and advises on operational issues \\n\\nDavid is very much the optimist very much the deal\\nmaker said Greg Brenneman a former president of\\nContinental Jim is very much a counterbalance to David\\nHe will sit back and ask the tough questions He will\\napproach investments a little bit more skeptically than\\nDavid does \\n\\nBy the end of the 1990s Texas Pacific was well\\nestablished in deal making It easily raised 45 billion\\nfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000 To\\ncelebrate their war chest the firms partners rented San\\nFranciscos City Hall and hired the B52s to play at a\\nparty \\n\\nBut as the stock market began to tumble Texas Pacific\\nhesitated For a 17month stretch the partners made no\\ndeals They checked out some of the biggest corporate\\nblowups including Adelphia Xerox and Global Crossing but\\nstayed away finding the prices and the quality of the\\nbusinesses untenable \\n\\nInstead Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\\ninvestments taking more than 2 billion in profits during\\nthat stretch \\n\\nThey started to cash out early in the cycle said Mario\\nGiannini chief executive of Hamilton Lane a money\\nmanagement firm some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\\ninvestors \\n\\nThe good times of the late 1990s were not ideal for Texas\\nPacific  it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\\nneeded its help \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\\nrough It revived Oxford Health Plans the health\\nmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\\nmid1990s almost doubling its money after bringing in new\\nmanagers and upgrading computer systems In 1996 it made a\\n280 million investment in Ducati Motor the Italian\\nmotorcycle maker whose profits have since more than\\nquadrupled \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific also stumbled usually when it bought at\\nthe top of the market Texas Pacifics 560 million\\ninvestment in the J Crew Group the clothing retailer for\\nwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997\\nhas been a disappointment So has its 1999 purchase of\\nBally the shoe maker which has suffered from lower demand\\nfor luxury goods \\n\\nTexas Pacific also lost more than 100 million on Zilog a\\nsemiconductor company and Favorite Brands a candy maker\\nboth of which filed for bankruptcy \\n\\nSome of these investments have taken a toll on the firms\\nperformance Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\\ntwo investment funds it raised over the last decade The\\nfirst fund a 720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\\nincluding investments made through March 1997 should\\nreturn more than 40 percent according to one Texas Pacific\\ninvestor But its second fund  25 billion raised in 1997\\n could return less than half that this investor\\nestimated since the firm had less time to take profits on\\nthese investments before the stock market sank \\n\\nBut because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\\nin the second fund profits on these investments could\\nrebound It is hoping for example that with new\\nmanagement in place J Crew will turn around as the\\neconomy rebounds In any case one competitor said their\\nreturns look pretty good when you consider that some other\\nfunds wont return any capital to investors \\n\\nBut with the weak economy throwing many companies into\\ntrouble Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\\nsuccess the investor said They should do exceptionally\\nwell he said \\n\\nTexas Pacific has a distinct style  if not formula It\\nrelies on talented selfsufficient managers to restructure\\ntroubled companies preferring to remain handsoff except\\nfor surveillance from the boardroom When necessary it\\nreplaces managers \\n\\nLess than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy\\nfor example Mr Bonderman watched with frustration as his\\nold friend Robert R Ferguson the chief executive led it\\nto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court \\n\\nContinentals board where Mr Bonderman was chairman then\\nbrought in Gordon M Bethune an executive at Boeing and\\nin October 1994 he replaced Mr Ferguson as chief\\nexecutive Mr Bethune quickly did a toptobottom overhaul\\nof the company and is now considered a great turnaround\\nartist of the industry \\n\\nThe biggest conflict Ive ever seen was with Bob\\nFerguson said Clark Onstad a former general counsel for\\nthe Federal Aviation Administration in describing the\\nthinking of Mr Bonderman whom he has known since the 1982\\nBraniff bankruptcy He chose Bethune over his longtime\\nfriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\\nbetter job \\n\\nAt America West Texas Pacific initiated an even more\\nextensive management overhaul This time the charge was\\nled by Mr Coulter and Mr Schifter both directors \\n\\nW Douglas Parker the current chief executive flew to Mr\\nCoulters home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\\nchief financial officer They talked for hours and Mr\\nParker said the two men quickly realized they had somewhat\\nkindred spirits \\n\\nThe board replaced most senior managers at America West\\nexcept William Franke the chief executive who stepped\\ndown last September His restructuring plan had made the\\nairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\\nbankruptcy in August 1994 \\n\\nTexas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West worth\\nabout 337 million But those are controlling shares and\\nthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes \\n\\nThese are not passive investors nor am I said Donald L\\nSturm a Denver businessman who serves on Continentals\\nboard with Mr Bonderman and Mr Price Youre active\\nYour money is at stake Your reputation is at stake \\n\\nAfter overseeing managers who worked successfully with\\nunions at Continental and America West Texas Pacific has a\\ngood reputation with labor That was one reason US Airways\\nwas interested in a Texas Pacific investment said Chris\\nChiames a spokesman for the airline \\n\\nMr Siegel wanted an investor who would be as labor\\nfriendly as possible Mr Chiames said But US Airways can\\nstill entertain other bids this fall and Marvin Davis the\\nbillionaire investor from Los Angeles has expressed\\ninterest \\n\\nTexas Pacifics investment in Burger King made with\\nGoldman Sachs and Bain Capital was announced after two\\nyears of discussions among Texas Pacifics partners and the\\nchains franchisees  even before the company which had\\nbeen owned by Diageo the liquor company was put up for\\nsale said Julian Josephson chairman of the National\\nFranchisee Association which represents most Burger King\\nfranchisees \\n\\nWe liked what they had to say about the human component of\\nthe businesses they buy Mr Josephson said Many other\\nowners he added are dismissive of labor \\n\\nAt Burger King Texas Pacific will also be working with an\\nexecutive it knows Burger Kings chief executive is John\\nDasburg the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines\\nwho met Mr Bonderman and his partners when Northwest\\nbought out their stake in Continental in 1998 \\n\\nUnlike most buyout firms Texas Pacific remains enamored\\nwith the technology industry despite the failure of so\\nmany startups the last two years It has focused on the\\nsemiconductor industry which like the airline industry is\\nhighly cyclical So far though results have been mixed \\n\\nThe firms 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation\\nwhich makes equipment for highspeed Internet connections\\nhas been a huge success Texas Pacific split it in two and\\ntook both parts public in the late 1990s selling most of\\nits stakes for 23 times its investment But a much larger\\ninvestment its 400 million acquisition of Zilog the chip\\nmaker in 1998 was made just before the economic crisis in\\nAsia caused chip prices to plummet Zilog filed for\\nbankruptcy last year \\n\\nTexas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third\\ncompany ON Semiconductor which it acquired for 16\\nbillion three years ago It invested 100 million more last\\nyear \\n\\nIts latest gamble on the industry the 6 deal for MEMC\\nmay prove the most lucrative The cost of mailing the\\npayment to EOn based in DÔøΩsseldorf Germany was actually\\nmore than the acquisition one executive close to the deal\\nsaid \\n\\nTexas Pacific and its partners in the deal Trust Company\\nof the West and Leonard Green  Partners agreed to\\nguarantee a 150 million revolving line of credit Texas\\nPacific also assumed 900 million worth of debt most of\\nwhich it swapped for more stock in the company \\n\\nThey did a good job of timing the acquisition said\\nNabeel Gareeb the companys chief executive who noted\\nthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit\\nsince the fourth quarter of 2000 \\n\\nBut Texas Pacifics interest in airlines is clearly\\nsizable Besides its involvement in Continental America\\nWest and US Airways the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet\\nthe catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group \\n\\nTwo years ago Texas Pacific started a Webbased discount\\nticket service called Hotwire It put up most of the 75\\nmillion in seed money then persuaded six airlines to\\ninvest with it said Karl Peterson the chief executive\\nHotwire instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets as\\nPriceline does shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site\\nbut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until\\nafter the sale \\n\\nThe contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt\\nHotwire which is privately owned Mr Peterson said that\\nthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific\\nremains committed to it \\n\\nLast spring Mr Peterson met Mr Bonderman in Aspen to\\ntalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding Mr Bonderman\\nseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the\\nsteep Internet chute But he does have his limits on risk\\nMr Peterson discovered Before going down the mountain\\nMr Bonderman strapped on a helmet ÔøΩ

FOX\\nBUTTERFIELD\\n\\nBOSTON Aug 24  It was March 1965 in the early days of J Edgar\\nHoovers war against the Mafia FBI agents say Congressional\\ninvestigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\\nNew Englands organizedcrime boss Raymond Patriarca\\n\\nTwo gangsters Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi wanted Mr\\nPatriarcas permission to kill a smalltime hoodlum Edward Deegan\\nas they were having a problem with him according to an FBI log\\nof the conversation Patriarca ultimately furnished this OK the\\nFBI reported and three days later Mr Deegan turned up dead in an\\nalley shot six times\\n\\nIt was an extraordinary situation The Federal Bureau of\\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two wellknown\\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\\nMafia was involved\\n\\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967 the real\\nkillers  who also happened to be informers for the FBI  were\\nleft alone Four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to\\ndeath or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing\\nto do with it\\n\\nOne Joseph Salvati who spent 30 years in prison filed notice with\\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the FBI\\nfor 300 million for false imprisonment\\n\\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the FBI the\\nJustice Department and some FBI agents growing out of the tangled\\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the FBIs Boston\\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob\\n\\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry But some of\\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light\\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr Patriarca\\napproved the murder They were released as part of an investigation\\nby the House Committee on Government Reform which has pressured the\\ndepartment into turning over records about the FBI in Boston\\n\\nThe documents show that officials at FBI headquarters apparently\\nincluding Mr Hoover knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\\nprotecting them from prosecution\\n\\nJ Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\\nhimself said Vincent Garo Mr Salvatis lawyer He allowed a\\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\\none of his informants\\n\\nMr Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr Salvati and\\nmay have implicated him because Mr Salvati owed 400 to a loan shark\\nwho worked for Mr Barboza\\n\\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr Hoover knew of Mr\\nSalvatis innocence when he was put on trial Gail Marcinkiewicz a\\nspokeswoman for the FBI in Boston declined to comment citing the\\npending litigation\\n\\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\\nmisconduct in the Boston office In one of the first results of the\\ninvestigation one retired agent John J Connolly is awaiting\\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\\nFBI informers James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi Vincent and\\nStephen Flemmi are brothers\\n\\nThe Government Reform Committee led by Representative Dan Burton\\nRepublican of Indiana has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureaus knowledge\\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr Barboza were involved in killing Mr\\nDeegan A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime\\nincluding who fired the first shot\\n\\nThen on June 4 1965 Mr Hoovers office demanded to know what\\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer\\n\\nIn a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the Boston\\noffice said that Mr Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr Patriarca potentially\\ncould be an excellent informant\\n\\nThe agent also informed Mr Hoover that Mr Flemmi was known to have\\nkilled seven men and from all indications he is going to continue\\nto commit murder Nevertheless the agent said the informants\\npotential outweighs the risk involved\\n\\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling The most\\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmis murders\\nthe director does not even respond the investigator said There is\\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant\\n\\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\\npressure on Mr Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\\npower of the Mafia which he had largely ignored In Boston FBI\\nagents recruited Mr Barboza and Mr Flemmi and developed close ties\\nto a rival criminal organization the Winter Hill Gang led by Mr\\nBulger\\n\\nBoth sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and\\nthe trial of Mr Connolly The FBI got information that eventually\\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families which controlled\\norganized crime in New England Mr Bulgers gang was able to take\\nover the rackets in Boston sell drugs and even commit murder while\\nthe FBI looked the other way\\n\\nOne reason the FBI may not have used its information about Mr\\nPatriarcas involvement in the Deegan murder Congressional\\ninvestigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device\\nin his Providence RI headquarters The FBI agent who\\ntranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information was\\ncoming from unnamed informants to disguise the use of the device\\nthe investigators say\\n\\nMr Salvati a former truck driver now 69 had his sentence commuted\\nin 1997 by Gov William F Weld Last year while he was still on\\nparole his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state\\njudge after the Justice

million\\nlawsuit against the Justice Department Mr Limone was sentenced to\\ndie in the electric chair His life was spared only when\\nMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974\\n\\nMr Salvati

research into defining and addressing classes\\nof vulnerabilities cant happen without libraries of available\\nvulnerability code  I can think of three researchers into automated\\nmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about\\nthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites  Doing research into\\na set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you\\ncan define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so\\nyou can make and test predictions\\n\\n   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we\\nwouldnt have Stackguard

Sitaker kragenpoboxcom\\n To forkexamplecom\\n Subject the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards\\n \\n On August 7th an entity known as iDEFENSE sent out an announcement\\n which is appended to this email  Briefly iDEFENSE which bills\\n itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash\\n for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software\\n that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell\\n anyone else\\n \\n If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a\\n very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure\\n \\n At the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research\\n known as full disclosure people who discover security\\n vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short\\n while later  after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem\\n  they publish the information including code to exploit the\\n vulnerability if possible  \\n \\n This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by\\n CERT in the late 1980s which its proponents might call responsible\\n disclosure  never release working exploit code and never release\\n any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released\\n a patch  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\\n vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\\n on features and often even after the patches were released people\\n wouldnt apply them because they didnt know how serious the problem\\n was\\n \\n The underground computer criminal community would often discover and\\n exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible\\n disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the\\n underground vulnerable\\n \\n The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\\n are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to\\n reduce their potential impact  including disabling software\\n turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and\\n detecting and responding to intrusions  They are therefore much less\\n useful to wouldbe intruders  Also software companies usually see\\n security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems and so\\n prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as\\n long as possible\\n \\n iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\\n than either of the two previous paradigms  They want to be a buyer in\\n a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding\\n discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash  \\n \\n Not long before Snosoft a group of security researchers evidently\\n including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the\\n secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\\n vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to\\n HewlettPackard to keep a vulnerability in HPs Tru64 Unix secret if\\n HP retained Snosofts consulting services  HP considered this\\n extortion and responded with legal threats and Snosoft published the\\n information\\n \\n If this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which\\n together add up to a catastrophe\\n \\n First secret software vulnerability information will be available to\\n the highest bidder and to nobody else  For reasons explained later\\n I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\\n syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers\\n \\n Second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\\n become lucrative for many more talented people  The result will be\\n  just as in the responsible disclosure days  that the good\\n guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority\\n of current vulnerabilities are kept secret\\n \\n Ive heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\\n vendors of the vulnerable software but I dont think thats\\n plausible  If someone can steal 20 000 because a software bug lets\\n them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the\\n people who administer the software arent liable either  when\\n credit card data are stolen from an ecommerce site for example\\n Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a website\\n administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some\\n negative PR but it can net the thief thousands of dollars\\n \\n I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\\n information is most lucrative  the thieves who can use it to\\n execute the largest heists without getting caught  Inevitably that\\n means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who\\n are good at networked theft may not yet exist\\n \\n There might be the occasional case where a market leader such as\\n Microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\\n than a gang could make by theft  Think of a remoteroot hole in\\n Samba for example\\n \\n Right now people who know how to find security exploits are either\\n motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public\\n interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or\\n personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits  Creating\\n a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\\n increase the availability of that information to the people who can\\n afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime\\n \\n Lets not let that happen\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n This is the original iDEFENSE announcement\\n \\n From Sunil James mailtoSJamesiDefensecom\\n Sent Wednesday August 07 2002 1232 PM\\n Subject Introducing iDEFENSEs Vulnerability Contributor Program\\n \\n \\n Greetings\\n \\n iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\\n Contributor Program VCP The VCP pays contributors for the advance\\n notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code\\n \\n iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP The following\\n provides answers to some basic questions about the program\\n \\n Q How will it work\\n A iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\\n security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number\\n of motivations including the following\\n \\n           Pure love of security research\\n           The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\\n           The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\\n           The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\\n \\n The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\\n Internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the\\n workThe compensation will depend among other things on the following\\n items\\n \\n           The kind of information being shared ie vulnerability or exploit\\n           The amount of detail and analysis provided\\n           The potential severity level for the information shared\\n           The types of applications operating systems and other\\n            software and hardware potentially affected\\n           Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\\n           The level of exclusivity if any for data granted to iDEFENSE\\n \\n Q Who should contribute to the VCP\\n A The VCP is open to any individual security research group or other\\n entity\\n \\n Q Why are you launching this program\\n A Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence Contributions\\n to some lists take time before publication to the public at large More\\n often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the\\n original contributor Under the iDEFENSE program the contributor is\\n compensated iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue and iDEFENSE clients and the\\n public at large are warned in a timely manner\\n \\n Q Who gets the credit\\n A The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or\\n exploit information\\n \\n Q When can I contribute\\n The VCP is active You are welcome to begin contributing today\\n \\n To learn more go to httpwwwidefensecomcontributorhtml If you have\\n questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP please\\n contact us at

courtesy of the Harrow Report theres no written \\nevidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the \\ninfamous quote attributed to him Its kind of astounding that there is \\nenough general social consensus 25 of all queries makes it a very \\nFAQ and eyewitness reporting without a single written source What \\nthe essay below doesnt seem to answer though is what the earliest \\nattributed quote in print by any other writer is Id naturally be much \\nmore skeptical if the quote emerged after his death RK\\n\\n\\nhttpwwwdirksencenterorgfeaturesBillionHerehtm\\n\\nA billion here a billion there   \\n\\nDid Dirksen ever say  A billion here a billion there and pretty soon \\nyoure talking real money or anything very close to that\\n\\nPerhaps not Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio \\nrecords of The Dirksen Congressional Center staffers there have found \\nno evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to \\nhim\\n\\nArchivists undertook the search after studying research statistics \\nshowing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote \\nor its variations\\n\\nHere is what they examined all of the existing audio tapes of the famed \\nEv and Charlie and Ev and Jerry shows all newspapers clippings in \\nthe Dirksen Papers about 12500 pages of Dirksens own speech notes \\ntranscripts of his speeches and media appearances transcripts of \\nRepublican leadership press conferences and Dirksens statements on the \\nSenate floor as documented in the Congressional Record\\n\\nAlthough Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech preferring to \\nrely on notes he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular \\nturn of phrase For example in referring to the public debt or \\nexcessive government spending Dirksen would jot the word pothole to \\nremind him to tell the following story on this occasion in reference to \\nthe debt ceiling\\n\\n\\nAs I think of this bill and the fact that the more progress we make \\nthe deeper we go into the hole I am reminded of a group of men who were \\nworking on a street They had dug quite a number of holes When they got \\nthrough they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to \\nthe hole and they had a nice little mound which was quite a traffic \\nhazard\\n\\nNot knowing what to do with it they sat down on the curb and had a \\nconference After a while one of the fellows snapped his fingers and \\nsaid ÔøΩI have it I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth \\nand remove the hazard We will just dig the hole deeper \\nCongressional Record June 16 1965 p 13884\\n\\n\\nOn the same occasion Dirksen relied on yet another spending story \\none he labeled cat in the well\\n\\n\\nOne time in the House of Representatives a colleague told me a story \\nabout a proposition that a teacher put to a boy He said ÔøΩJohnny a cat \\nfell in a well 100 feet deep Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and \\nthen fell back 2 feet How long would it take the cat to get out of the \\nwell\\n\\nJohnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a \\nwhile and then when the teacher came down and said ÔøΩHow are you \\ngetting along Johnny said ÔøΩTeacher if you give me another slate and \\na couple of slate pencils I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes \\nI can land that cat in hell\\n\\nIf some people get any cheer our of a 328 billion debt ceiling I do \\nnot find much to cheer about concerning it Congressional Record June \\n16 1965 p 13884\\n\\n\\nBut there are no such reminders for the A billion here a billion \\nthere     tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksens \\nnotemaking tendencies He spoke often and passionately about the debt \\nceiling federal spending and the growth of government Yet there is no \\nauthoritative reference to the billion phrase\\n\\nThe chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from \\npeople who claim to have heard him The Library of Congress for \\nexample cites someones personal observation on the campaign trail as \\nevidence The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard \\nDirksen say those words some even providing the date of the event But \\ncrosschecking that information with the records has so far turned up \\nnothing in the way of confirmation\\n\\nThe closest documented statement came at a joint SenateHouse Republican \\nleadership press conference on March 8 1962 when Dirksen said The \\nfavorite sum of money is 1 billion ÔøΩ a billion a year for a fatter \\nfederal payroll a billion here a billion there EMD Papers \\nRepublican Congressional Leadership File f 25 But the and pretty \\nsoon youre talking real money is missing\\n\\nIn another close call the New York Times January 23 1961 quoted \\nDirksen Look at education ÔøΩ twoandonehalf billion ÔøΩ a billion for \\nthis a billion for that a billion for something else Three to five \\nbillion for public works You havent got any budget balance left \\nYoull be deeply in the red Cited in Byron Hulseys Everett Dirksen \\nand the Modern Presidents PhD dissertation May 1998 University of \\nTexas p 226\\n\\nOf course the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late \\nSenators comments For example The Center that bears his name does not \\nhave his testimony before committees Their collection of Congressional \\nRecords ends in 1965 omitting the last four years of Dirksens life and \\ncareer ÔøΩ he might have employed the phrase only late although witnesses \\nclaim he said it throughout his career Dirksens campaign speeches \\ntended not to produce transcripts only sketchy notes or abbreviated \\nnewspaper accounts Dirksen also held center stage before the video age \\nmeaning that many remarks particularly those in campaigns escaped \\ncapture\\n\\nBottom line the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have \\nendorsed

McCarthy\\nWashington Post Staff Writer\\nTuesday August 27 2002 Page E01\\n\\nIf John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago he might have\\nsought a stake in the new economy He might have dreamed of becoming an\\nace codecracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency or imagined\\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software Maybe he would have tried to\\nuse the Internet to end world hunger\\n\\nBut as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week hes harboring\\ndifferent academic ambitions The Ashburn native says he wants to do\\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers\\n\\nBesides he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room you\\ncant get the chicks with that anymore\\n\\nThe tech industrys financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\\nsome fairweather students But now theres another consequence of the tech\\nbust Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\\ncome to a halt\\n\\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\\n2001 according to a report by the Computing Research Association And\\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating with some\\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins\\n\\nThe word is out among department deans that the busts fallout has trickled\\ninto the classroom said Maria Clavez president of the Association of\\nComputing Machinery\\n\\nIve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\\ndeclines said Clavez who will become the dean of science and engineering\\nat Princeton University in January It can be hard to see this because at\\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\\nexceeds the available space But it is going to have an effect\\n\\nAt Virginia Tech enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year to 300 At George Washington\\nUniversity the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\\nscience fell by more than half this year\\n\\nInterest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\\npast decade In 1997 schools with PhD programs in computer science and\\ncomputer engineering granted 8063 degrees according to the Computing\\nResearch Association The numbers rose through 2001 when 17048 degrees\\nwere awarded\\n\\nThe Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\\nfastestgrowing occupation between 2000 and 2010 with other\\ncomputerrelated industries trailing close behind\\n\\nBut in the short term that growth may slow based on the changes among\\ncollege students For example 900 of the 2000plus undergraduates studying\\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\\ncomputer science majors last year This year the enrollment in that major is\\ndown to 800 although a newly created and more general information\\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students\\n\\nHaving it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief said Lloyd Griffith\\ndean of George Masons information technology and engineering school\\nParticularly with the field as it has been they dont want to spend four\\nyears on something and then not get a job\\n\\nFreshman enrollment for the University of Marylands computer science major\\nis expected to be about 167 this fall down from 329 last year Maryland\\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent but that alone does\\nnot account for the drop said Steve Halperin dean of Marylands College of\\nComputer Mathematical and Physical Sciences\\n\\nWe are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major Halperin said Thats a\\nfactual statement But I would say that at this point    we dont expect\\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates Many of the kids who are no\\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off\\n\\nYandziak who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday is not\\nconvinced thats the case He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class\\nwith a 39 gradepoint average and nailed the highest possible score on his\\nadvancedplacement exam in computer science\\n\\nAll of my classes have been easy for me Math and sciences were always fun\\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things Yandziak\\nsaid Im just not sure I want my life to be immersed in technology I\\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world\\n\\nHarris N Miller president of the Information Technology Association of\\nAmerica said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals\\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage\\n\\nThere was a tremendous imbalance in the late 90s potentially you have the\\nsame sort of thing going on right now People are saying I dont need this\\nkind of IT training right now  Miller said Our concern as an industry\\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment down the\\nroad four years as the economy picks up once again companies are going to\\nfind themselves in a shortage situation\\n\\nEconomic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices but other\\nfactors including program difficulty personal interests and social\\ninfluences also come into play said Judy Hingle director of professional\\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association The perception\\nof computer science as an isolating nerdy profession is one that many in\\nthe industry have tried to squelch That stereotype went underground during\\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust\\n\\nAll the hipness is gone Yandziak said Once we thought of the Internet\\nas this thing with infinite capabilities It was basically just a fad that\\ncame along\\n\\nLamont Thompson a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\\nthe District is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\\nmarketing with the intention of going into real estate development\\n\\nTechnology comes natural to people my age its not fascinating anymore\\nThompson said To be honest with you when I think computer science I\\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room Its a\\nnecessity but I

three programmers  In those cases its always very hard to get the\\nprogrammers to agree on APIs memory management techniques etc  With\\nJava the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you dont

saying that there is a standard set of APIs for CC for\\neverything aside to the minimal ANSI stuff  Is there a standard way of\\ndealing with CC applications for various domain problems messaging\\ndatabase persistence etc that rivals Java  Id like to know if there is\\none accepted by everyone who writes CC In that case I claim\\nignorance\\n\\nNot suggesting that Java is the golden

the area acts as a repeater or router relaying \\ntraffic for everyone else Traffic hops from person to person until it \\nreaches the nearest internet access point reducing the need for central \\nantennas and improving wireless coverage\\n\\nAs the number of mobile phones soars and wireless PDAs laptops and \\nother devices begin to crowd the spectrum this approach to wireless \\nnetworking may be inevitable\\n\\nMesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless \\nnetworks While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users \\nconnection speeds of up to 144 kbps roughly three times faster than a \\ndialup modem Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection \\nspeeds of up to 6Mbps over a hundred times faster than dialup The \\ntechnologies they use include WiFi  the emerging standard for highspeed \\nwireless networking also known as 80211b A similarly shortrange \\nprotocol called UltraWideBand which is poised to succeed WiFi is even \\nfaster and could by 2005 approach 400 Mbps\\n\\nThe range of a typical WiFi network is generally too limited to be of \\nmuch use when travelling around a city Mesh networks get around the \\nproblem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic \\nEven though the range of any individual device is relatively small \\nbecause in theory there will be so many users in the surrounding area \\nconnections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless \\nconnection\\n\\nBecause mesh networks use WiFi the equipment and infrastructure needed \\nto create them is cheap and readily available Instead of building \\ncellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds all \\nthat is needed to get a network going are wireless access points around \\nÔøΩ100 now placed strategically around town to relay traffic and the \\nproper software Existing laptops and PDAs can be meshenabled by \\nsoftware\\n\\nIt also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network \\nUnlike with 3G cellular the part of the spectrum that WiFi operates on \\nis unregulated in the US Britain The mobile phone companies are none too \\npleased about this especially since many of them spent billions of pounds \\nacquiring 3G licences\\n\\nAll thats needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect \\nto the network With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets \\nbetter instead of getting worse as is the case with mobile phone \\nnetworks\\n\\nBut things get very interesting when you realise that when you have \\nhighspeed internet connections everywhere and everyones laptops PDAs \\nand mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds sharing \\nmusic movies or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy When \\nUltraWideBand hits all of this will just accelerate\\n\\nAt 400Mbps copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the \\nperson sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds \\nSooner or later playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of \\ntheir favourite songs movies and video games\\n\\nBut the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers \\nMeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own highspeed wireless service \\nInstead the company plans to sell its technology to others such as cities \\nthat want to provide wireless internet to police fire and public works \\nemployees or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the \\ncheap Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for \\nenterprise networks\\n\\nThe first place average users may use the technology is when it is \\nincorporated into vehicles enabling motorists to access the internet at \\nhigh speeds which both companies see happening soon\\n\\nWhen will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in \\nyour pocket Its too soon to say but just as broadband internet service \\nwas initially available only to businesses and universities eventually \\nsomeone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

part  Im guessing your argument is that people not only want\\ninstant view but also instant show  Which is what this service\\noffers  Im not convinced that most people want instant show  I think\\npeople like to package their pictures and show them  Thats why people put\\ntogether fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while\\nthey explain every picture  Sure occasionally instant show is nice but\\nits just nice on occasion  I still cant see how it becomes a integral\\nmessaging method\\n\\nWhats the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\\nfrom one phone to another  There has to be some benefit even if its\\nsilly if people are going to flock to it\\n\\nIm searching no one has given me a straight answer yet\\n\\nThe only really intriguing idea Ive heard about things like MMS lately\\nare Dan Gillmors assertion that one day in the near future some news event\\nwill happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\\nphones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of\\nwhat happened  before the press even gets there\\n\\nWilling to be proven wrong\\nMike\\n\\nPS If the wireless

Friends Indeed Do More Harm Than Good\\n\\nSeptember 10 2002\\nBy MARY DUENWALD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nFriends are supposed to be good for you In recent years\\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\\nstrong friendships experience less stress they recover\\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\\nlonger than the friendless They are even less susceptible\\nto the common cold studies show \\n\\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect Some lie\\ninsult and betray Some are overly needy Some give too\\nmuch advice Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends \\n\\nFriendship is often very painful said Dr Harriet\\nLerner a psychologist and the author of The Dance of\\nConnection In a close enduring friendship jealousy\\nenvy anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\\nrear their heads One has to decide whether the best thing\\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\\nis bad for my health and Im disbanding it \\n\\nAnother book When Friendship Hurts by Dr Jan Yager a\\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford\\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside\\nTheres this myth that friendships should last a\\nlifetime Dr Yager said But sometimes its better that\\nthey end \\n\\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable considering\\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\\nfriendship at all Marriage and family relationships \\nbetween siblings or parents and children  have been seen\\nas more important \\n\\nOf course troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are And\\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\\nbad \\n\\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books Dr\\nLerner said Never once have I had anyone write and say my\\nbest friend hits me \\n\\nDr Beverley Fehr a professor of psychology at the\\nUniversity of Winnipeg noted that sociological changes\\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate have added weight to the\\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health \\n\\nNow that a marital relationship cant be counted on for\\nstability the way it was in the past and because people\\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\\nmembers people are shifting their focus to friendships as\\na way of building community and finding intimacy said Dr\\nFehr the author of Friendship Processes \\n\\nUntil the past couple of years the research on friendship\\nfocused on its health benefits Now were starting to look\\nat it as a more full relationship said Dr Suzanna Rose\\na professor of psychology at Florida International\\nUniversity in Miami Like marriage friendship also has\\nnegative characteristics \\n\\nThe research is in its infancy Psychologists have not yet\\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship Dr Fehr said\\nSo far they have only through surveys and interviews\\nfigured out that it is a significant problem The early\\nresearch Dr Fehr added is showing that betrayal by a\\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought \\n\\nHow can a friend be bad Most obviously Dr Rose said by\\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise illadvised\\npursuit When you think of people who were friends at\\nEnron she added you can see how friendship can support\\nantisocial behavior \\n\\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship When friends\\nsplit up said Dr Keith E Davis a professor of\\npsychology at the University of South Carolina it is\\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential\\n\\n\\nAnother form of betrayal Dr Yager said is when a friend\\nsuddenly turns cold without ever explaining why Its\\nmore than just pulling away she said The silent\\ntreatment is actually malicious \\n\\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friends\\nromantic partner as recently happened to one of Dr\\nLerners patients I would not encourage her to hang in\\nthere and work this one out Dr Lerner said \\n\\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\\nthe other person Dr Yager said One of the 180 people who\\nresponded to Dr Yagers most recent survey on friendship\\ndescribed how when she was 11 her best friend called her\\na derogatory name The woman now 32 was so devastated\\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\\npeople ever since Dr Yager said \\n\\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse\\nbut it is more insidious Dr Yager said Some people\\nconstantly set up their friends she explained Theyll\\nhave a party not invite the friend but make sure he or\\nshe finds out \\n\\nRisk takers betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\\nkinds of bad friends Dr Yager said but they are not the\\nonly ones She identifies 21 different varieties Occupying\\nthe second tier of badness are the liar the person who is\\noverly dependent the friend who never listens the person\\nwho meddles too much in a friends life the competitor and\\nthe loner who prefers not to spend time with friends \\n\\nMost common is the promise breaker This includes everyone\\nfrom the person who says lets have a cup of coffee but\\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\\npromises to be there for you when you need them but then\\nisnt Dr Yager said \\n\\nSome friendships go bad as some romantic relationships do\\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\\nto dislike the other one \\n\\nWith couples it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\\ndiscover theres something important they dont like about\\nthe other person said Dr Rose of Florida International\\nOne might find for example that in subtle ways the other\\nperson is a racist In friendships which are less intense\\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\\nothers dislike criteria \\n\\nWhether a friendship is worth saving Dr Lerner said\\ndepends on how large the injury is \\n\\nSometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\\nsomething go she added Its also an act of maturity\\nsometimes to accept another persons limitations \\n\\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\\nspouses Dr Lerner said because people have more than one\\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\\nfrom each one \\n\\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\\nfriendship is causing undue stress the healthy response is\\nto pull away Dr Yager said to stop sharing the personal\\nor intimate details of life and start being too busy to\\nget together ever \\n\\nIt takes two people to start and maintain a friendship\\nbut only one to end it Dr Yager said \\n\\nFriendship because it is voluntary and unregulated is far\\neasier to dissolve than marriage But it is also\\ncomparatively fragile experts say Ideally the loss of a\\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\\nappreciation for good ones Dr Lerner said \\n\\nIt is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\\nthem in order while youre healthy and your life and work\\nare going well she said Because when a crisis hits\\nwhen someone you love dies or you lose your job and your\\nhealth insurance when the universe gives you a crash\\ncourse in vulnerability you will discover how crucial and\\nlifepreserving good friendship is\\n\\nhttpwwwnytimescom20020910healthpsychology10FRIEhtmlex1032684795ei1en2a88a6d1b985c977\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n\\nFor

the towers the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon and the murder of 3000 Americans ÔøΩ all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over ÔøΩ tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds\\nwhich if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades The killers\\ndealt in icons ÔøΩ the choice of 911 as the date of death targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world Yes\\nthey got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally\\nrepugnant ÔøΩ and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 911 they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal ÔøΩ and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for It is one thing to kill innocents quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban the Iranian mullocracy\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas and any other wouldbe fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation Our coalition with\\nEurope we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of EuroAmerican globetrotters ÔøΩ\\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar The truth is that Europe out of noble purposes for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU a 80000person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings Indeed as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in the European way became all too apparent\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and\\nconstant American anklebiting even as Europe lives in a makebelieve Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11\\n\\nAmerica learned that moderate Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations After September 11 being a Saudi Egyptian or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American ÔøΩ at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan Syrian or Lebanese citizenship\\nIndeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism oil and arms purchases ÔøΩ like NATO ÔøΩ belongs to a\\npre911 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting statesponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles ÔøΩ and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies Worstcase scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more longterm hope than stable regimes like the Saudis governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us ÔøΩ and vice versa the

fundamentalists And with good reason Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed\\n\\nThe post911 domestic calculus is just as confusing Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq chicken\\nhawks and worse Yet such traditional Vietnamera invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11 and sounds more like McClellans shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Pattons audacity in charging after murderous Nazis\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago Indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank God there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military ÔøΩ other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf Mogadishu and Panama ÔøΩ who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharms way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in highrises\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down In the old days cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik In the age of Russian expansionism they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with naÔøΩve and idealist leftists\\n\\nNo longer The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics loot their treasuries and keep out the Russians Instead\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists The latter if\\nmulticulturalists often believe that democracy is a valueneutral Western\\nconstruct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim\\nnonintervention not justice as their first priority The Right not the\\nLeft now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and\\nidealism ÔøΩ with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support\\n\\nAll

down from our offices into the\\nsixstory crater where the Twin Towers once stood Like everyone\\nelse we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\\ndied a year ago But we also think the best memorial to those who\\nperished would be a living one\\n\\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions\\nespecially today anger grief and respect for the many acts of\\nheroism that took place there But underlying it all is the memory of\\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted The best\\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\\nworking meeting shopping eating  that is engaged in the sort of\\nproductive work and play that used to take place there Osama bin\\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery\\n\\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\\nbeen about So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan which lost 100000 jobs when the\\nTrade Center fell Instead the discussion centers on the size and\\nscale of the memorial and on satisfying every political interest now\\nclamoring for a piece of the action New Yorks political leadership\\nand its financial and media elites are squandering a historic chance\\nto rebuild a better more prosperous city\\n\\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\\nwhat to do with the site In consultation with New York Governor\\nGeorge Pataki who is thinking primarily about his own November\\nreelection the commission made the decision to focus first on the\\nmemorial The Manhattan Institutes Steve Malanga argues that the\\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\\nfor the memorial getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\\nto the memorial This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\\nsuccessfully done  rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\\nan outdoor memorial a design for which has yet to be decided\\n\\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the citys\\nantidevelopment activists know an opening when they see one They\\nwant the World Trade Center site  and even some surrounding areas\\n  transformed into an enormous park These political advocates have\\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation and the World\\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment Worse they are\\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\\nantidevelopment agenda in the name of honoring the dead One\\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site\\n\\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials but were confident\\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the worlds financial center\\nisnt the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago The great\\ncities of Europe and Japan devastated in World War II have all\\nrebuilt and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\\nlife Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam the Dutch port\\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing where survivors erected a\\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be\\n\\nIn this country the practice has been for the names of war dead to\\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\\naffiliated If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University\\nyoull find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\\nWar the War of 1812 the Civil War the SpanishAmerican War World\\nWar I World War II Korea and Southeast Asia No one thinks it\\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\\naround the walls containing their names\\n\\nIn New York now it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the citys future\\nRudolph Giuliani now that hes out office wants the entire 16 acres\\ndevoted to the memorial Governor Pataki has called for no structures\\non the footprints which being in the center of the site would\\nseverely curtail options Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\\npress and has since ducked for cover\\n\\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past Maybe\\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months The best\\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce\\n\\nBEGIN PGP SIGNATURE\\nVersion PGP

years ago has seen the nationÔøΩs capital city successfully attacked \\nBut one year ago President George W Bush was thrown into the first \\ngreat crisis of the 21st century\\n\\nThis is the presidentÔøΩs story of September 11th and the week America \\nwent to war 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr Bush one on Air \\nForce One and another in the Oval Office last week Even after a year \\nthe president is still moved sometimes to the point of tears when he \\nremembers Sept 11\\n\\nÔøΩI knew the farther we get away from Sept11 the more likely it is for \\nsome around the world to forget the mission but not meÔøΩ Mr Bush says \\nduring the Air Force One interview ÔøΩNot me I made the pledge to myself \\nand to people that IÔøΩm not going to forget what happened on Sept 11 So \\nlong as IÔøΩm president we will pursue the killers and bring them to \\njustice We owe that to those who have lost their livesÔøΩ\\n\\nThe memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One where Pelley \\njoined the president for a recent trip across country 60 Minutes II \\nwanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first \\nhours after the attack\\n\\nNot since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane \\nbeen so central to America in a crisis\\n\\nFor President Bush Sept 11 2001 started with the usual routine \\nBefore dawn the president was on his fourmile run It was just before \\n6 am and at the same moment another man was on the move Mohammad \\nAtta Two hours later as Mr Bush drove to an elementary school \\nhijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the \\nairliners east As the motorcade neared the school at 845 am jet \\nengines echoed in Manhattan\\n\\nAtta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One\\n\\nÔøΩI thought it was an accidentÔøΩ says Mr Bush ÔøΩI thought it was a pilot \\nerror I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and  and made a \\nterrible mistakeÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a \\nclass of second graders He was watching a reading drill when just \\nafter nine United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower There was \\nthe sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was \\na coordinated attack\\n\\nBack in the Florida classroom press secretary Ari Fleischer got the \\nnews on his pager The presidentÔøΩs chiefofstaff Andy Card stepped in\\n\\nÔøΩA second plane hit the second tower America is under attackÔøΩ Card \\ntold the president\\n\\nWhen he said those words what did he see in the PresidentÔøΩs face\\n\\nÔøΩI saw him coming to recognition of what I had saidÔøΩ Card recalls ÔøΩI \\nthink he understood that he was going to have to take command as \\ncommanderinchief not just as presidentÔøΩ\\n\\nWhat was going through BushÔøΩs mind when he heard the news\\n\\nÔøΩWeÔøΩre at war and somebody has dared attack us and weÔøΩre going to do \\nsomething about itÔøΩ Mr Bush recalls ÔøΩI realized I was in a unique \\nsetting to receive a message that somebody attacked us and I was \\nlooking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war I \\ncan remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to \\nget the calls and seeing the look on their face And it became evident \\nthat we were you know that the world had changedÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone He called \\nthe vice president pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the \\nattack on TV Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first \\nwords to the nation\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen this is a difficult moment for AmericaÔøΩ he said \\nin the speech ÔøΩToday weÔøΩve had a national tragedyÔøΩ\\n\\nIt was 930 am As he spoke Mr Bush didnÔøΩt know that two more \\nhijacked jets were streaking toward Washington Vice Pesident Dick \\nCheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent \\nran in\\n\\nÔøΩHe said to me ÔøΩSir we have to leave immediatelyÔøΩ and grabbed put a \\nhand on my belt another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the \\ndoor of my officeÔøΩ Cheney recalls ÔøΩIÔøΩm not sure how they do it but \\nthey sort of levitate you down the hallway you move very fastÔøΩ\\n\\nÔøΩThere wasnÔøΩt a lot of time for chitchat you know with the vice \\npresidentÔøΩ says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford who was in his \\ncommand center ordering the roundup of top officials and the First \\nFamily He felt that he had only minutes to work with ÔøΩWe knew there \\nwere unidentified planes tracking in our directionÔøΩ he says\\n\\nCheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the \\nPresidential Emergency Operations Center It was built for war and this \\nwas it On her way down National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \\ncalled Mr Bush\\n\\nÔøΩIt was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get \\nout of the West WingÔøΩ says Rice ÔøΩThey were hurrying me off the phone \\nwith the president and I just said he said ÔøΩIÔøΩm coming backÔøΩ and we \\nsaid ÔøΩMr President that may not be wiseÔøΩ I remember stopping briefly \\nto call my family my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say ÔøΩIÔøΩm fine You \\nhave to tell everybody that IÔøΩm fineÔøΩ but then settling into trying to \\ndeal with the enormity of that moment and in the first few hours I \\nthink the thing that was on everybodyÔøΩs mind was how many more planes \\nare comingÔøΩ\\n\\nThe Capitol was evacuated And for the first time ever the Secret \\nService executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of \\nsuccession Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become \\npresident if the others were killed They wanted to move Vice President \\nCheney fearing he was in danger even in the bunker But Cheney says \\nwhen he heard the other officials were safe he decided to stay at the \\nWhite House no matter what\\n\\nÔøΩItÔøΩs important to emphasize its not personal you donÔøΩt think of it in \\npersonal terms youÔøΩve got a professional job to doÔøΩ says Cheney\\n\\nCheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers \\nhearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the \\ncapital\\n\\nSays Mineta ÔøΩSomeone came in and said ÔøΩMr Vice president thereÔøΩs a \\nplane 50 miles outÔøΩ then he came in and said ÔøΩIts now 10 miles out we \\ndonÔøΩt know where it is exactly but itÔøΩs coming in low and fastÔøΩÔøΩ\\n\\nIt was American Flight 77 At 938 am it exploded into the Pentagon \\nthe first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812\\n\\nAs the Pentagon burned Mr BushÔøΩs limousine sped toward Air Force One \\nin Florida At that moment United Flight 93  the last hijacked plane  \\nwas taking dead aim at Washington At the White House the staff was in \\nthe West Wing cafeteria watching on TV Press Secretary Jennifer \\nMillerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate\\n\\nÔøΩI no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled \\nÔøΩWomen drop your heels and run drop your heels and runÔøΩ and suddenly \\nthe gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and \\nthe whole White House just flooded outÔøΩ she recalls\\n\\nIn Florida as Mr Bush boarded Air Force One he was overheard telling \\na Secret Service agent ÔøΩBe sure to get the First Lady and my daughters \\nprotectedÔøΩ At 957 am Air Force One thundered down the runway \\nblasting smoke and dust in a full hrust take off Communications \\nDirector Dan Bartlett was on board\\n\\nÔøΩIt was like a rocketÔøΩ he remembers ÔøΩFor a good ten minutes the plane \\nwas going almost straight upÔøΩ\\n\\nAt the same moment 56 minutes after it was hit World Trade Center \\nTower Two began to falter then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche \\nof steel concrete and human lives\\n\\nÔøΩSomeone said to me ÔøΩLook at thatÔøΩ I remember that ÔøΩLook at thatÔøΩ and \\nI looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and \\nthe horror of that momentÔøΩ recalls Rice of the TV newscast\\n\\nShe also felt something in her gut ÔøΩThat weÔøΩve lost a lot of Americans \\nand that eventually we would get these people I felt the anger Of \\ncourse I felt the angerÔøΩ\\n\\nDown in the bunker Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked \\nplanes there were Officials feared there could be as many as 11\\n\\nAs the planes track toward Washington a discussion begins about whether \\nto shoot them down ÔøΩI discussed it with the presidentÔøΩ Cheney \\nrecalls ÔøΩÔøΩAre we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these \\nairliners that have been hijackedÔøΩ He said yesÔøΩ\\n\\nÔøΩIt was my advice It was his decisionÔøΩ says Cheney\\n\\nÔøΩThatÔøΩs a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot \\ndown your own civilian aircraftÔøΩ says Bush ÔøΩBut it was an easy \\ndecision to make given the ÔøΩ given the fact that we had learned that a \\ncommercial aircraft was being used as a weapon I say easy decision it \\nwas I didnÔøΩt hesitate let me put it that way I knew what had to be \\ndoneÔøΩ\\n\\nThe passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done They \\nfought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow \\nThe flight was 15 minutes from Washington\\n\\nÔøΩClearly the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of \\ngovernment as they could the Pentagon perhaps the Capitol perhaps the \\nWhite House These people saved us not only physically but they saved us \\npsychologically and symbolically in a very important way tooÔøΩ says \\nRice\\n\\nMeanwhile Tower One was weakening It had stood for an hour and 43 \\nminutes At 1029 am it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of \\nits twin\\n\\nThe image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure \\nlocation somewhere in Washington ÔøΩI was horrifiedÔøΩ she says ÔøΩI \\nthought ÔøΩDear God protect as many citizens as you canÔøΩ It was a \\nnightmareÔøΩ\\n\\nBy 1030 am AmericaÔøΩs largest city was devastated its military \\nheadquarters were burning Air force One turned west along the Gulf \\nCoast\\n\\nÔøΩI can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the \\nconsequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining \\nmoment in the history of the United StatesÔøΩ says President Bush ÔøΩI \\ndidnÔøΩt need any legal briefs I didnÔøΩt need any consultations I knew we \\nwere at warÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush says the first hours were frustrating He watched the \\nhorrifying pictures but the TV signal was breaking up His calls to \\nCheney were cutting out Mr Bush says he pounded his desk shouting \\nÔøΩThis is inexcusable get me the vice presidentÔøΩ\\n\\nÔøΩI was trying to clear the fog of war and there is a fog of war says \\nthe president Information was just flying from all directionsÔøΩ\\n\\nChief of staff Card brought in the reports There was word Camp David \\nhad been hit A jet was thought to be targeting Mr BushÔøΩs ranch\\n\\nÔøΩI remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit or \\nthat the White House had a fire in it So we were hearing lots of \\ndifferent informationÔøΩ says Card\\n\\nThey also feared that Air Force One itself was a target Cheney told the \\npresident there was a credible threat against the plane Using the code \\nname for Air Force One Mr Bush told an aide ÔøΩAngel is nextÔøΩ The \\nthreat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman\\n\\nÔøΩIt was serious before that but now it is no longer is it a time to get \\nthe president homeÔøΩ Tillman says ÔøΩWe actually have to consider \\neverything we say everything we do could be intercepted and we have to \\nmake sure that no one knows what our position isÔøΩ\\n\\nTillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret \\nService agents doublechecked the identity of everyone on board The \\ncrew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan Then came a warning from \\nair traffic control ÔøΩ a suspect airliner was dead ahead\\n\\nÔøΩComing out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an \\nairliner off our nose that they did not have contact withÔøΩ Tillman \\nremembers\\n\\nTillman took evasive action pulling his plane high above normal \\ntraffic They were on course for Washington but by now no one thought \\nthat was a good idea except the president\\n\\nÔøΩI wanted to come back to Washington but the circumstances were such \\nthat it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national \\nsecurity team to clear the way for Air Force One to come backÔøΩ says \\nBush\\n\\nSo Air Force One set course for an underground command center in \\nNebraska Back in Washington the presidentÔøΩs closest advisor Karen \\nHughes heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr \\nBush\\n\\nÔøΩAnd the military operator came back to me and in a voice that to me \\nsounded very shaken said ÔøΩMaÔøΩam IÔøΩm sorry we canÔøΩt reach Air Force \\nOneÔøΩÔøΩ Hughes recalls Hughes was out of the White House during the \\nattacks When she came back it was a place she didnÔøΩt recognize\\n\\nÔøΩThere were either military or maybe Secret Service dressed all in \\nblack holding machine guns as as we drove up And I never expected to \\nsee something like that in in our nations capitalÔøΩ says Hughes\\n\\nWhen she walked into the White House no one was inside ÔøΩI knew it was \\na day that you didnt want to surprise anybody and so I yelled \\nÔøΩHelloÔøΩ and two again kind of SWAT team members came running running \\nthrough the the hall with again guns drawn and then took me to to \\nthe location where I met the vice presidentÔøΩ\\n\\nOn Air Force One Col Tillman had a problem He needed to hide the most \\nvisible plane in the world a 747 longer than the White House itself He \\ndidnÔøΩt want to use his radio because the hijackers could be listening \\nto air traffic control So he called air traffic control on the \\ntelephone\\n\\nÔøΩWe actually didnt tell them our destination or what directions we were \\nheadingÔøΩ says Tillman ÔøΩWe we basically just talked to em and said \\nOK fine we have no clearance at this time we are just going to fly \\nacross the United StatesÔøΩ\\n\\nControllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another warning \\neach other to keep the route secret\\n\\nÔøΩOK whereÔøΩs he goingÔøΩ one tower radioed to another\\n\\nÔøΩJust watch himÔøΩ a second tower responded ÔøΩDonÔøΩt question him whereÔøΩs \\nhes going Just work him and watch him thereÔøΩs no flight plan in and \\nweÔøΩre not going to put anything in Ok sirÔøΩ\\n\\nAir Force One ordered a fighter escort and air traffic control radioed \\nback ÔøΩAir Force One got two F16s at about your 10 oÔøΩclock positionÔøΩ\\n\\nÔøΩThe staff and the president and us were filed out along the outside \\nhallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windowsÔøΩ \\nsays Bartlett ÔøΩAnd the president gives them a signal of salute and the \\npilot kind of tips his wing and fades off and backs into formationÔøΩ\\n\\nThe men in the F16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts from the \\nTexas Air National Guard Their mission was so secret their commander \\nwouldnÔøΩt tell them where they were going\\n\\nÔøΩHe just said YouÔøΩll know when you see it and that was my first \\nclue I didnÔøΩt have any idea what we were going up until that pointÔøΩ \\nsays Brotherton He knew when he saw it\\n\\nÔøΩWe we were trying to keep an 80mile bubble bubble around Air Force \\nOne and wed investigate anything that was within 80 milesÔøΩ says \\nRoberts\\n\\nBush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this \\naircraft or for his own safety ÔøΩI looked out the airplane and saw two \\nF16s on each wing It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to \\nget usÔøΩ\\n\\nWe now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war \\na false alarm But it had a powerful effect at the time Some wondered \\nwith the president out of sight was he still running the government He \\nhadnÔøΩt appeared after the attack on Washington Mr Bush was clearly \\nworried about it At one point he was overheard saying ÔøΩThe American \\npeople want to know where their dang president isÔøΩ The staff considered \\nan address to the nation by phone but instead Mr Bush ordered Air Force \\nOne to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV At \\n1145 am they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana\\n\\nÔøΩThe resolve of our great nation is being tested But make no mistake \\nwe will show the world that we will pass this test God blessÔøΩ Bush \\nsaid to the nation from Barksdale\\n\\nAt Barksdale the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington \\nwas still unsafe So the plane continued on to Nebraska to the command \\ncenter where Mr Bush would be secure and have all the communications \\ngear he needed to run the government Aboard Air Force One Mr Bush had \\na job for press secretary Fleischer\\n\\nÔøΩThe president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that \\nwas said I think he wanted to make certain that a record existedÔøΩ says \\nFleischer\\n\\nFleischerÔøΩs notes capture Mr BushÔøΩs language plain and unguarded To \\nthe vice president he said ÔøΩWeÔøΩre at war Dick weÔøΩre going to find out \\nwho did this and kick their assÔøΩ Another time Mr Bush said ÔøΩWeÔøΩre \\nnot going to have any slaponthewrist crap this timeÔøΩ\\n\\nThe President adds ÔøΩI can remember telling the Secretary of Defense I \\nsaid ÔøΩWeÔøΩre going to find out who did this and then Mr Secretary you \\nand Dick MyersÔøΩ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs ÔøΩare \\ngoing to go get themÔøΩÔøΩ\\n\\nBy 3 pm Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in \\nNebraska Mr Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that \\ngave no hint of what they would find below\\n\\nAt the bottom of the stairs was the US Strategic Command Underground \\nCommand Center It was built to transmit a presidentÔøΩs order to go to \\nnuclear war But when Mr Bush walked in the battle staff was watching \\nthe skies over the United States Many airplanes had still not landed \\nAfter a short briefing Mr Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference \\ncenter which connected them to the White House the Pentagon the FBI \\nand the CIA Mr Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent\\n\\nAccording to Rice Bush asked Tenent who had done this Rice recalls \\nthat Tenent answered ÔøΩSir I believe its al Qaeda WeÔøΩre doing the \\nassessment but it looks like it feels like it smells like al QaedaÔøΩ\\n\\nThe evidence would build FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an \\nessential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed\\n\\nA flight attendant on American Flight 11 Amy Sweeney had the presence \\nof mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the \\nseat numbers of the hijackers ÔøΩThat was the first piece of hard \\nevidence We could then go to the manifest find out who was sitting in \\nthose seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those \\nindividuals as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and \\ngoing through a process of eliminationÔøΩ says Mueller\\n\\nIn Nebraska the White House staff was preparing for an address to the \\nnation from the Air Force bunker but by then the president had had \\nenough He decided to come back\\n\\nÔøΩAt one point he said he didnÔøΩt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him \\nout of WashingtonÔøΩ Fleischer says ÔøΩThat verbatimÔøΩ\\n\\nOn board he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world \\nÔøΩI had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged One was that \\nyoure guilty if you harbor a terrorist because I knew these terrorists \\nlike alQaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people The \\nother thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition \\nof countries that would either be with us or with the terroristsÔøΩ\\n\\nAs Air Force One sped east the last casualty of the attack on America \\ncollapsed one of the nationÔøΩs worst days wore into evening At the \\nWorld Trade Center 2801 were killed at the Pentagon 184 and in \\nPennsylvania 40 Altogether there were 3025 dead\\n\\nÔøΩAnybody who would attack America the way they did anybody who would \\ntake innocent life the way they did anybody whos so devious is evilÔøΩ \\nBush said recently\\n\\nMr Bush would soon see that evil face to face After arriving in \\nWashington he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the \\nway to the White House\\n\\nWas there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White \\nHouse to return to ÔøΩI donÔøΩt remember thinking about whether or not the \\nWhite House would have been obliterated he recalls I think I might \\nhave thought they took their best shot and now it was time for us to \\ntake our best shotÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks \\nHis next step was an address to the nation Karen Hughes and her staff \\nwere already working on the speech\\n\\nÔøΩHe decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was \\nreassuranceÔøΩ remembers Hughes ÔøΩWe had to show resolve we had to \\nreassure people we had to let them know that we would be OKÔøΩ\\n\\nJust off the Oval Office Mr Bush added the words that would become \\nknown as the Bush Doctrine  no distinction between terrorists and those \\nwho harbor them The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr \\nBush didnÔøΩt think the American people wanted to hear it that night and \\nhe was emphatic about that\\n\\nHe prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first \\nheard the news of Pearl Harbor Now Bush was commander in chief Eighty \\nmillion Americans were watching\\n\\nÔøΩToday our fellow citizens our way of life our very freedom came under \\nattack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist actsÔøΩ he said \\nfrom the Oval Office that night\\n\\nThe Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American \\nhistory since the Civil War Before he walked to the White House \\nresidence for the night Mr Bush dictated these words for the White \\nHouse daily log ÔøΩThe Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today \\nWe think its Osama bin LadenÔøΩ\\n\\nCBSÔøΩWhen Sept 12 dawned President Bush was demanding a war plan No \\none in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the \\npresident would do In office for just eight months heÔøΩd never been \\ntested as commanderinchief\\n\\nÔøΩI never asked them what they thoughtÔøΩ President Bush said of the \\nPentagon brass ÔøΩbecause I didnÔøΩt really ÔøΩ because I knew what I was \\ngonna do I knew exactly what had to be done Scott And that was to set \\na strategy to seek justice Find out who did it hunt them down and \\nbring them to justiceÔøΩ\\n\\nIn the cabinet room the president made clear what was next ÔøΩThe \\ndeliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against \\nour country were more than acts of terror they were acts of warÔøΩ he \\nsaid\\n\\nTo the war cabinet al Qaeda was no surprise National Security Advisor \\nCondoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to \\nstrike bin LadenÔøΩs organization well before Sept 11\\n\\nÔøΩThe president said ÔøΩYou know IÔøΩm tired of swatting at flies I need a \\nstrategy to eliminate these guysÔøΩÔøΩ Rice recalls\\n\\nIn one of the worst intelligence failures ever the CIA and FBI didnÔøΩt \\npick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent Without \\na sense of urgency the White House strategy the president had asked for \\ncame too late\\n\\nChief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr Bush had asked for \\nwas ÔøΩliterally headed to the presidentÔøΩs desk I think on the eleventh \\ntenth or eleventh of SeptemberÔøΩ\\n\\nOn Sept 12 the war cabinet was debating the full range of options  \\nwho to hit and how to hit them There were some at the Pentagon who \\nworried in the early hours that Mr Bush would order up an immediate \\ncruise missile strike of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in \\nthe past\\n\\nÔøΩWell thereÔøΩs a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon anywayÔøΩ Mr \\nBush tells Pelley ÔøΩA lot of people like to chatter you know more than \\nthey should But no I appreciate that very much Secretary of Defense \\nDonald Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what \\nwe called ÔøΩboots on the groundÔøΩ That if youÔøΩre gonna go to war then \\nyouÔøΩve gotta go to war with all your assetsÔøΩ\\n\\nThe president says he wanted to ÔøΩfight and win a guerilla war with \\nconventional meansÔøΩ\\n\\nIt was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director \\nGeorge Tenent Tenent wanted to combine American technology and \\nintelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the \\nTaliban government\\n\\nSecretary of State Colin Powell noting that the CIA had already \\ndeveloped a long relationship with the Afghan resistance called it an \\nunconventional solution to an unconventional problem\\n\\nÔøΩAs I like to describe it to my friendsÔøΩ Powell says ÔøΩwe had on the \\nground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some \\nCIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force the \\nbest in the world How do you connect it allÔøΩ\\n\\nThe president gave them 48 hours to figure it out\\n\\nMeanwhile Mr Bush went to the battlefield himself Just the day \\nbefore he had called the Pentagon the ÔøΩmightiest building in the \\nworldÔøΩ Now onefifth of it was in ruins The wreckage of American \\nFlight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators And before Mr Bush \\nleft he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering \\nthe remains of the first casualties of war on his watch\\nThe next day Sept 13 there was another warning of attack that the \\npublic never heard about Threats had been were coming in constantly but \\nthis one sounded credible a large truck bomb headed to the White House \\nThe Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker\\n\\nÔøΩHe wasnÔøΩt real receptive to that to that recommendationÔøΩ remembers \\nBrian Stafford director of the Secret Service ÔøΩAnd he ordered a \\nhamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening \\nand thatÔøΩs what he didÔøΩ\\n\\nThe next day would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the \\npresident On Friday Sept 14 Mr Bush started the day with a cabinet \\nmeeting but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause\\n\\nÔøΩHe sat down slightly overcome for a moment but he recaptured itÔøΩ \\nsays Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have \\ntrouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service \\nlater that morning\\n\\nÔøΩAnd I just scribbled a little note to himÔøΩ Powell recalls ÔøΩand I \\nsaid ÔøΩMr President IÔøΩve learned over the years when you are going to \\ngive a very emotional speech watch out for certain words that will \\ncause you to start to tear upÔøΩ He looked at me and he smiled and then \\nat the next break in the conversation he said ÔøΩThe Secretary of State \\ntold me not to break down at the memorial serviceÔøΩ and that broke the \\ntension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassedÔøΩ\\n\\nFirst Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and \\nshe says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting ÔøΩI wanted \\nthe Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting because I think \\nwe were a country that needed everyone of us needed comfortingÔøΩ\\n\\nIt also stirred the mournersÔøΩ resolve as Rice remember ÔøΩAs we stood to \\nsing the Battle Hymn of the RepublicÔøΩ she says ÔøΩyou could feel the \\nentire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen the kind \\nof spine and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve\\n\\nÔøΩWe all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had \\nbeen lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what \\nhad happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually \\ngoing to be safe from this kind of attack ever againÔøΩ\\n\\nNext came a visit to ground zero The president was not prepared for \\nwhat he encountered there\\n\\nÔøΩYou couldnÔøΩt brief me you couldnÔøΩt brief anybody on ground zero until \\nyou saw it Mr Bush says ÔøΩIt was like ÔøΩ it was ghostly Like youÔøΩre \\nhaving a bad dream and youÔøΩre walking through the dreamÔøΩ\\n\\nThe president found the scene very powerful particularly when the men \\nand women at ground zero began to chant ÔøΩUSA USAÔøΩ\\n\\nÔøΩThere was a lot of bloodlustÔøΩ the president recalls ÔøΩPeople were you \\nknow pointing their big old hands at me saying ÔøΩDonÔøΩt you ever forget \\nthis Mr President DonÔøΩt let us downÔøΩ The scene was very powerful \\nVery powerfulÔøΩ\\n\\nWhen Mr Bush tried to speak the crowd kept shouting ÔøΩWe canÔøΩt hear \\nyouÔøΩ\\n\\nThe president responded ÔøΩI can hear you I can hear you The rest of \\nthe world hears you And the people who knocked these buildings down \\nwill hear all of us soonÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before heÔøΩd posed with \\nthe firemen who always stood by whenever the presidentÔøΩs helicopter \\nlanded there Now five of the men who stood with the president in the \\npicture were dead ÔøΩ lost at ground zero\\n\\nWhen the president arrived Sept 14 Manhattan was papered with the \\nfaces of the lost Families unable to believe that so many had vanished \\nin an instant held onto the hope that their loved ones were just \\nmissing It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother\\n\\nAt a meeting the public never saw the president spoke with several \\nhundred of these families in a convention hall\\n\\nÔøΩPeople said to me ÔøΩHeÔøΩll come out DonÔøΩt worry Mr president weÔøΩll \\nsee him soon I know my loved one he will  heÔøΩll find a place to \\nsurvive underneath the rubble and weÔøΩll get him outÔøΩ I on the other \\nhand had been briefed about the realities and my job was to hug and \\ncry but I remember the whole time thinking ÔøΩThis is incredibly sad \\nbecause the loved ones wonÔøΩt come outÔøΩÔøΩ\\n\\nOne little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his \\nfirefighter uniform and as he signed it Mr Bush remembers he told the \\nboy ÔøΩYour daddy wonÔøΩt believe that I was here so you show him that \\nautographÔøΩ\\n\\nIt was an effort ÔøΩto provide a little hopeÔøΩ the president recalls ÔøΩI \\nstill get emotional thinking about it because weÔøΩre dealing with people \\nwho loved their dads or loved their mom or loved theirÔøΩwives who loved \\ntheir husbands It was a tough time you know it was a tough time for \\nall of us because we were a very emotional and I was emotional at \\ntimes I felt I felt the same now as I did then which is sad And I \\nstill feel sad for those who grieve for their families but through my \\ntears I see opportunityÔøΩ\\n\\nThe president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes \\nhe stayed for two and a half hours It was there he met Arlene Howard \\nThe body of her son George was among the first to be found at ground \\nzero\\n\\nÔøΩI called the police departmentÔøΩ Howard remembers ÔøΩ and they said he \\nhadnÔøΩt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said \\nÔøΩNo I donÔøΩt need to call backÔøΩ If he hadnÔøΩt called in I knew where he \\nwasÔøΩ\\n\\nGeorge Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 \\nwhen the World Trade Center was bombed He had been off duty that day \\nand he was off duty on Sept 11 but couldnÔøΩt stay away The police \\ndepartment gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president\\n\\nÔøΩHe the president he leaned over to talk to meÔøΩ Howard recalls ÔøΩAnd \\nhe extends his sympathy to me and thatÔøΩs when I asked him IÔøΩd like to \\npresent GeorgeÔøΩs shield to him in honor of all the men and women who \\nwere killed over thereÔøΩ\\n\\nBy the end of that day Mr Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained\\n\\nÔøΩHe was physically exhausted he was mentally exhausted he was \\nemotionally exhausted he was spiritually exhaustedÔøΩ recalls Card\\n\\nThe next day ÔøΩ Saturday Sept 15  Mr Bush met members of his war \\ncabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting\\n\\nÔøΩMy message is for everybody who wears the uniform ÔøΩ get ready The \\nUnited States will do what it takesÔøΩ Mr Bush told them\\n\\nAs Powell remembers it ÔøΩHe was encouraging us to think boldly He was \\nlistening to all ideas he was not constrained to any one idea he \\nwanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each otherÔøΩ\\n\\nPresident Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made ÔøΩOn the \\nother handÔøΩ he says ÔøΩI wanted to clarify plans and I went around the \\nroom and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happenÔøΩ\\n\\nWhen he left that meeting on Saturday night he still had not told the \\ncabinet what he was planning\\n\\nÔøΩI wanted to just think it throughÔøΩ Mr Bush remembers ÔøΩAny time you \\ncommit troops to harmÔøΩs way a president must make sure that he fully \\nunderstands all the consequences and ramifications And I wanted to just \\nspend some time on it alone And didÔøΩ\\n\\nWhat were his reservations\\n\\nMr Bush says ÔøΩCould we win I didnÔøΩt want to be putting our troops in \\nthere unless I was certain we could win And I was certain we could winÔøΩ\\n\\nNine days after the attacks on America before a joint session of \\nCongress the president committed the nation to the war on terror\\n\\nÔøΩEach of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it \\nhappenedÔøΩ Mr Bush told the Congress and the nation ÔøΩWeÔøΩll remember \\nthe moment the news came where we were and what we were doing Some \\nwill remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue Some will carry \\nmemories of a face and a voice gone forever And I will carry this It \\nis the police shield of a man named George Howard who died at the World \\nTrade Center trying to save others It was given to me by his mom \\nArlene as a proud memorial to her son It is my reminder of lives that \\nended and a task that does not endÔøΩ\\n\\nA year has passed since then but the president says his job is still to \\nremind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being \\nwaged a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office \\nliterally keeping score one terrorist at a time\\n\\nIn his desk the president says ÔøΩI have a classified document that \\nmight have some pictures on there just to keep reminding me about whoÔøΩs \\nout there where they might beÔøΩ\\n\\nAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed ÔøΩI might make a little \\ncheck there yeahÔøΩ Mr Bush admits\\n\\nBut there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list ÔøΩ \\nOsama bin Laden\\n\\nCBSÔøΩA lot has happened in the year since Sept 11 One year ago the \\npresident was new on the job with little experience in foreign policy \\nHe had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements Now \\non his orders US forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did \\nnot expect in a world completely changed In the Oval Office last week \\nCBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq \\nabout whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden\\n\\n\\n\\nScott Pelley You must be frustrated maybe angry After a year we \\nstill donÔøΩt have Osama Bin Laden\\n\\nPresident Bush How do you know that I donÔøΩt know whether Osama bin \\nLaden is dead or alive I donÔøΩt know that HeÔøΩs not leading a lot of \\nparades And heÔøΩs not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he \\nwas This is much bigger than one person anyway This is ÔøΩ weÔøΩre slowly \\nbut surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that that \\nhates America And we will stay on task until we complete the task I \\nalways knew this was a different kind of war Scott See in the old \\ndays you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his \\ntanks or his airplanes and his ships This is an international manhunt \\nWeÔøΩre after these people one at the time TheyÔøΩre killers Period\\n\\nPelley But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or \\nalive\\n\\nMr Bush If he were dead thereÔøΩs somebody else to replace him And we \\nwould find that person But slowly but surely we will dismantle the al \\nQaeda network And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them And \\nat the same time hopefully lay the seeds for the conditions necessary \\nso that people donÔøΩt feel like theyÔøΩve got to conduct terror to achieve \\nobjectives\\n\\nPelley Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts \\nCertainly weÔøΩve overthrown the Taliban government Certainly al Qaeda \\nhas been scattered But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have \\ngotten away And there have been many civilian casualties as well\\n\\nMr Bush Uh huh Well you know I am sad that civilians lost their \\nlife But I understand war We did everything we can to ÔøΩ everything we \\ncould to protect people When civilians did die it was because of a \\nmistake Certainly not because of intention We liberated a country for \\nwhich IÔøΩm extremely proud No ÔøΩ I donÔøΩt second guess things ItÔøΩs ÔøΩ \\nthings never go perfect in a time of war\\n\\nPelley Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein\\n\\nMr Bush IÔøΩm committed to regime change\\n\\nPelley There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war \\nin Iraq Some of our allies in the Gulf War Saudi Arabia Turkey for \\nexample Even your fatherÔøΩs former national security advisor Mr \\nScowcroft has written about it in the paper What is it in your \\nestimation that they donÔøΩt understand about the Iraq question that you \\ndo appreciate\\n\\nMr Bush The policy of the government is regime change Scott hasnÔøΩt \\nchanged I get all kinds of advice IÔøΩm listening to the advice I \\nappreciate the consultations And weÔøΩll consult with a lot of people but \\nour policy hasnÔøΩt changed\\n\\nPelley On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil\\n\\nMr Bush Yeah\\n\\nPelley I donÔøΩt think anyone would disagree with that but at the same \\ntime many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for \\npolitical reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the \\noil region of the Middle East Is there any change in foreign policy \\nthat youÔøΩre considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United \\nStates\\n\\nMr Bush Hmm Well IÔøΩm working for peace in the Middle East IÔøΩm the \\nfirst president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly \\ndeclared the need to have a Palestinian state living sidebyside with \\nIsrael in peace IÔøΩve made it clear that in order for there to be peace \\nthe Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror \\nand believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns \\nIve also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that \\ntheyÔøΩve got responsibilities If you want peace they gotta work toward \\nit WeÔøΩre more than willing to work for it but they have to work for it \\nas well But all this business isnÔøΩt going to happen as long as a few \\nare willing to blow up the hopes of many So we all gotta work to fight \\noff terror\\n\\nPelley Arafat has to go\\n\\nMr Bush Either heÔøΩs heÔøΩs been a complete failure as far as I am \\nconcerned Utter disappointment\\n\\nPelley There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties\\n\\nMr Bush YeahÔøΩ\\n\\nPelley In fact an appeals court recently was harsh about your \\nadministrationÔøΩs decision to close certain deportation hearings They \\nsaid quote ÔøΩA government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to \\nthe ConstitutionÔøΩ Where do you draw the line sir\\n\\nMr Bush I draw the line at the Constitution We will protect America \\nBut we will do so on within the guidelines of the Constitution \\nconfines of the Constitution spirit of the Constitution\\n\\nPelley Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you \\nas an idea that youÔøΩve thought ÔøΩNo thatÔøΩs too far I donÔøΩt wanna goÔøΩ\\n\\nMr Bush Nah not that that I remember And I am pleased with the \\nJustice Department I think that Attorney GeneralÔøΩs doing a fine job by \\nthe wayand to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure \\nthat they review decisions we make I think thatÔøΩs fine I mean thatÔøΩs \\ngood ItÔøΩs healthy ItÔøΩs part of America\\n\\nPelley Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of \\nfour freedoms Freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want \\nand freedom from fear Do we have that today Mr President Freedom from \\nfear\\n\\nMr Bush I think more than we did in retrospect The fact that we are \\non alert the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us \\nmore free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th \\nWeÔøΩve got more work to do\\n\\nPelley And Americans should not live their lives in fear\\n\\nMr Bush I donÔøΩt think so No I think Americans oughta know their \\ngovernmentÔøΩs doing everything possible to help And obviously if we get \\ninformation that relates directly a particular attack weÔøΩll deal with \\nit And if we get noise that deals with a general attack weÔøΩll alert \\npeople There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny \\nand run down leads And the American people need to go about their \\nlives It seems like they are\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Salman Rushdie\\nFriday March 8 2002 Page A33 Washington Post\\n\\nThe defining image of the week for me is of a small childs burned and \\nblackened arm its tiny fingers curled into a fist protruding from the \\nremains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad Gujarat in India The murder \\nof children is something of an Indian specialty The routine daily \\nkillings of unwanted girl babies    the massacre of innocents in \\nNellie Assam in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring \\nvillage    the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the \\nhorrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhis assassination \\nThey bear witness to our particular gift always most dazzlingly in \\nevidence at times of religious unrest for dousing our children in \\nkerosene and setting them alight or cutting their throats or \\nsmothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length \\nof wood\\n\\nI say our because I write as an Indian man born and bred who loves \\nIndia deeply and knows that what one of us does today any of us is \\npotentially capable of doing tomorrow If I take pride in Indias \\nstrengths then Indias sins must be mine as well Do I sound angry \\nGood Ashamed and disgusted I certainly hope so Because as India \\nundergoes its worst bout of HinduMuslim bloodletting in more than a \\ndecade many people have not been sounding anything like angry ashamed \\nor disgusted enough Police chiefs have been excusing their mens \\nunwillingness to defend the citizens of India without regard to \\nreligion by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to \\nthe same sentiments as the nation in general\\n\\nMeanwhile Indias political masters have been tuttutting and offering \\nthe usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control \\nIt has escaped nobodys notice that the ruling party the Bharatiya \\nJanata Party BJP or Indian Peoples Party and the Hindu extremists \\nof the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP or World Hindu Council are sister \\norganizations and offshoots of the same parent body Even some \\ninternational commentators such as Britains Independent newspaper \\nurge us to beware excess pessimism\\n\\nThe horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that were used \\nto it It happens every so often then it dies down Thats how life is \\nfolks Most of the time India is the worlds largest secular democracy \\nand if once in a while it lets off a little crazy religious steam we \\nmustnt let that distort the picture\\n\\nOf course there are political explanations Ever since December 1992 \\nwhen a VHP mob demolished a 400yearold Muslim mosque in Ayodhya which \\nthey claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram Hindu \\nfanatics have been looking for this fight The pity of it is that some \\nMuslims were ready to give it to them Their murderous attack on the \\ntrainload of VHP activists at Godhra with its awful atavistic echoes \\nof the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the trainload during the \\npartition riots of 1947 played right into the Hindu extremists hands\\n\\nThe VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and \\ninsufficient radicalism of Indias BJP government Prime Minister Atal \\nBihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a \\ncoalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJPs \\nmore extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together \\nBut it isnt working anymore In state elections across the country the \\nBJP is being trounced This may have been the last straw for the VHP \\nfirebrands Why put up with the governments betrayal of their fascistic \\nagenda when that betrayal doesnt even result in electoral success\\n\\nThe electoral failure of the BJP is thus in all probability the spark \\nthat lit the fire The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the \\nsite of the demolished Ayodhya mosque  thats where the Godhra dead \\nwere coming from  and there are reprehensibly idiotically \\ntragically Muslims in India equally determined to resist them Vajpayee \\nhas insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and \\nwrongs of the Ayodhya issue The VHP is no longer prepared to wait\\n\\nThe distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi in a letter to Indias \\npresident K R Narayanan blames the Gujarat government led by a BJP \\nhardliner as well as the central government for doing too little too \\nlate She pins the blame firmly on the motivated wellplanned out and \\nprovocative actions of the Hindu nationalists But another writer the \\nNobel laureate V S Naipaul speaking in India just a week before the \\nviolence erupted denounced Indias Muslims en masse and praised the \\nnationalist movement\\n\\nThe murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced and Mahasveta Devi in \\nher letter demands stern legal action against them But the VHP is \\ndetermined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such \\npublic pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting \\nthem Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces \\nthe Nobel award\\n\\nThe political discourse matters and explains a good deal But theres \\nsomething beneath it something we dont want to look in the face \\nnamely that in India as elsewhere in our darkening world religion is \\nthe poison in the blood Where religion intervenes mere innocence is no \\nexcuse Yet we go on skating around this issue speaking of religion in \\nthe fashionable language of respect What is there to respect in any \\nof this or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around \\nthe world in religions dreaded name How well with what fatal results \\nreligion erects totems and how willing we are to kill for them And \\nwhen weve done it often enough the deadening of affect that results \\nmakes it easier to do it again\\n\\nSo Indias problem turns out to be the worlds problem What happened in \\nIndia has happened in Gods name The problems name is God\\n\\nSalman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay \\ncollection Step Across This
